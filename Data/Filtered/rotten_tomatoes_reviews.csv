0,Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief,"Whether audiences will get behind The Lightning Thief is hard to predict. Overall, it's an entertaining introduction to a promising new world -- but will the consuming shadow of Potter be too big to break free of?",3.5/5
1,Please Give,"Holofcener always gives us more to chew on than originally meets the eye in her films and she writes female characters with an intelligence, sensitivity and realism that blows the Sex and the City foursome away any day of the week.",3/4
2,10,Obvious but entertaining portrayal of midlife crisis gone horribly awry.,4/5
3,12 Angry Men (Twelve Angry Men),"In a time of bloated when special effects have become the real stars, going back to a classic like this can remind viewers what movie making is supposed to be about -- acting.",4/4
4,"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea",[The] embodiment of Disney at his best -- family entertainment that superbly uses brand-new wonders of film technology.,7/10

11,The Accused,The Accused demonstrates that rape victims often are suspects in their own cases.,3/4
12,The Lost City,"Despite the strong emotional connection many Miamians will feel toward the movie, The Lost City falls far short of the sweep, complexity and passion it strives for.",2/4
13,The Breaking Point,Clearly the best movie adaptation of a Hemingway novel.,A
14,Adam's Rib,"Adam's Rib gives us writers, performers and a director all operating at peak levels of performance; it's a classic comedy.",86/100
15,The Bridge of San Luis Rey,Pedestrian...a high-minded snoozer studded with stars who all seem almost perversely miscast and directed in a grimly deliberate style designed to italicize every point.,D
16,The Prowler (Cost of Living ),A neat noir thriller.,B+
17,Criminal,We got two and a half more months of crap to go before we get to the holiday/awards season.,3/5
18,The Adventures of Mark Twain,There's more than enough weird and wise material to keep you entertained -- especially if you're an animation buff or a Samuel Clemens aficionado.,4/5
19,Deep Blue,"A nice piece of work, but unfortunately it smacks of bandwagon-jumping following the success of such docs as Winged Migration.",B
20,The Adventures of Robin Hood,"This is one of the truly great adventure films of all time, and features a terrific performance by the perfectly cast Flynn.",5/5
21,Man Hunt,a daring film that explicitly prefigures the surge of anti-Nazi cinema that was to come,3/4
22,Dead End,Like a Twilight Zone episode stretched out into a feature ... without adding much subtext.,2.5/5
23,Bandwagon,A funny and rollickingly good movie about the challenges of keeping a band together on the road.,3/5
24,Whore,"Director Russell is gifted with an eye for the extreme, but sometimes he gets ahead of himself, thinking that odd camera angles and crude delivery will save a threadbare plot.",2/5
25,Tristan & Isolde,Two phoned-in performances do not a romance make.,1.5/4
26,Wild Side,"The performances are all raw and natural, and they are filmed in a close-up and often very intimate way.",3/5
27,A Tale of Two Pizzas,For what the film had to work with -- a thin script -- it flawlessly achieved what it set it out to do.,B
28,Running Scared,An unapologetic in-your-face thriller that's sure to take those who are expecting a typical Paul Walker movie by surprise.,B+
29,Going the Distance,"It's a Bland, Dull, Dumb Movie.",44/100
30,Ultraviolet,"Ultraviolet will be studied with great interest in the future - not for its quality or its artistic merit, but rather to discover how a turd like this was made.",1.5/5
31,Home of the Brave,Powerful doc that indicts the FBI as much as it condemns the Ku Klux Klan.,B+
32,Arthur and the Invisibles (Arthur and the Minimoys),Luc Besson's Arthur and the Invisibles clears the smog left behind by the year's dubious family entertainments.,3/4
33,Malevolence,Stevan Mena's debut film carves up body after body in a ritual homage to the serial-killer genre.,2/5
34,Eternal,It's the multidimensional characterization and dialogue that elevates this film far far above being just a vampire movie with a more literate back-story.,3.5/5
35,A Farewell To Arms,We have David O. Selznick to blame for this bloated two-hour-+ Technicolor remake.,1.5/4
36,The Narrow Margin,This sleeper may very well be the best B-film ever made.,A
37,The Matador,"Like the down-and-out version of his Tailor of Panama character, Brosnan's performance here is a sincere treasure; possibly the most entertaining of his career.",3/4
38,Smile,"Smile is like a dose of cod liver oil: It may be good for you, but it's no fun.",1/5
39,The Intruder (L'Intrus),"It's intended to puzzle us -- and sure, the little puzzles peppered throughout the film are fine. It's the grand non-sequiturs that are distracting.",2/4
40,Saint Ralph,The first twenty minutes of Saint Ralph seem more like a primer on the up-close-and-personal art of adolescent self abuse than subtle narrative exposition.,2.5/5
41,The Baxter,"Chooses to embrace, rather than transcend via zany bawdiness, the schmaltzy genre within which it's operating.",2.5/4
42,Oliver Twist,This version of Twist is a flawless adaptation; finding the right balance between story and screen. Simply enthralling.,86/100
43,The Alamo,"Could Wayne have crafted a better film if he only tried his hand at directing, instead of putting on the hero's mantle as well? Doubtful.",D+
44,G,"The producers may be right to bemoan Hollywood's myopia; but it's the movie's execution, not its vision of an alternative African-American cinema, that delayed its release.",2/4
45,Alexander the Great,a colossal bore,2/5
46,Alfie,"The question the film asks is, ""Why not?"" Surely life is to be enjoyed? The answer is grimmer than you expect.",3/5
47,Neverwas,...unlikely to find much of an audience outside of the film festival circuit.,2/4
48,The Second Chance,... a sincerely (if not exactly subtly) performed spiritual drama with a faith-based lesson in humility and the practical charity of offering a helping hand.,C+
49,Moonlight,"With no common language, these two connect instantly -- perhaps it's the blood -- and embark on an emotionally wrenching journey in this visually appealing, occasionally heavy-handed thriller from Paula van der Oest.",3.5/5
50,Aliens,Scott's tension-building atmospherics are replaced by Cameron's high-octane punch.,A
51,Rise: Blood Hunter,"[Director] Gutierrez sustains a heightened mood of sex and violence that, without breaking new ground, entertains in the way Gothic flicks do: a combination of cheap thrills and a good old-fashioned crusade against evil.",2.5/4
52,All About Eve,"All About Eve (1950), is a realistic, dramatic depiction of show business and backstage life of Broadway and the New York theater. The devastating debunking of stage and theatrical characters was...",A
53,When Do We Eat?,"Making The Family Stone's shenanigans and schmaltz seem downright sophisticated by comparison, Salvador Litvak's Passover-themed film gives Jews an insufferable holiday family comedy to call their own.",1/4
54,The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green,audiences both gay and straight should enjoy the comical and romantic hijinks.,B+
55,Dirty,"Not entirely successful, but it's as twisted as a James Ellroy novel, and it may please genre fans who don't require the transubstantiation of spilled blood into the holy water of redemption.",2/4
56,Stay Alive,This game is so over.,D-
57,All of Me,Steve Martin's brilliant physical comedy is only the highlight of this satisfying little giggle-fest.,4.5/5
58,Dreamland,"After all the put-upon jokes about trailer trash, finally here is a place where the terminology of community really defines itself.",3/4
59,Independent Lens,Nowhere near as probing as it could or should be. Valuable points are blunted by too many talking heads.,2/4
60,All the King's Men,"Rossen's film chronicles this life of raw power with compelling scenes, and Crawford's performance is well-supported by the rest of the cast.",5/5
61,Street Fight,Street Fight sputters with anger and despair at the durability of dumb-cluck demagoguery in American politics.,3/4
62,Lost Horizon,"Just dull and forgettable, not the so-bad-it's-good camp classic some people insist.",1/5
63,The Motel,Funny and real.,3/4
64,Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos,"Such a heady combination of greed, girls and goals, all set to a pulsating funk background, should provide even a hardened football refusenik with 90 minutes (+ stoppage time) of entertainment.",4/5
65,Requiem,...never quite as compelling as Hller's performance...,2.5/4
66,Gui si (Silk),"Depois de prender a ateno do pblico durante sua metade inicial graas a idias e momentos interessantes, o roteiro se perde sem maiores avisos, transformando-se em uma baguna capaz de levar at mesmo o mais paciente dos espectadores  loucura.",2/5

68,The 4th Dimension,"Annoying, pretentious and impossible to follow.",1.5/5
69,"Bon Cop, Bad Cop","Accessible and entertaining, with enough local flavor to seem exotic to English viewers. Not only that, but it's FUN.",3/5
70,Amazing Grace,A terrific subject becomes a tepid morality play.,2/5
71,The Silence,"Stylish, sexy and deeply emotionally resonant.",3/4
72,Cocaine Cowboys,Informative documentary filmmaking that belongs as much on library shelves and agency case files as in your local theatre.,5/5
73,Gone,"In the end, the script lets the film down with its obvious twists, its naggingly illogical narrative and a general pointlessness.",2.5/5
74,The Situation,"Having served my duty by pointing out the main failures of the film, it's equally obligatory to say that by film's end you have a better understanding of the opposing interests that are deconstructing Iraq than media coverage conveys.",2.5/5
75,Snow Blind,"Snow Blind calls itself a documentary, but it never stops feeling like the in-house channel on a ski-lodge television.",2/5
76,Four Sheets to the Wind,A film with some wonderfuly oddball comedy while also being a very heart-felt statement about expanding on the person you are and finding your true voice.,3.5/5
77,The Tiger's Tail,"John Boorman's self-indulgent ""moral fable"" has promise ..., but like the dueling entrepreneurs who populate one strand of the narrative, delivers more sizzle than steak.",2/5
78,It's a Boy Girl Thing,"A worthy addition to the bodyswap genre, thanks to a decent script and superb performances from its likeable leads.",3/5
79,Slipstream,A visual masterpiece and an amazing achievement in cinematography and editing.,8/10
80,Delirious,"Just when you're sure you know how Delirious is going to close, DiCillo comes up with a capper that's as satisfying as it is understated.",4/5
81,Interview,"To their credit, Miller and Buscemi engage the audience's interest in what is essentially an extended conversation.",3/5
82,American Anthem,"A large portion of the movie is given over to gymnastics competitions, which are not explained or photographed well enough to be very interesting.",0.5/4
83,The Ten,"Hilarious stuff, though many of the segments go on too long, so that the gags tend to wear out their welcome.",7/10
84,The Happening,"The movie demonstrates a smart movie geek's obsession with the rhythms and gory details of horror storytelling, undermined by a pompous insistence on spiritual lessons of the tritest kind.",C
85,Molière,"Tirard's risk-free approach of of the life of French comedy's reformer, is as light-hearted and cooky, as Lassel Hallstrom's Casanova, just starring Moliere instead of the infamous womanizer, albeit with a much more European cast.",2.5/5
86,Straightheads (Closure),Exploitative and depressing.,2/5
87,Borderland,"Berman balances the weight of the actual events with the desire to mount a simply effective horror story, and I think he pulls it off quite well.",3.5/5
88,Spiral,"""The camera moves are jarring at times and soothing at others ... a skillful, well crafted piece.""",4/5
89,Alexandra,"Though not a top-notch Sokurov, his new film is a conceptually fascinating meditation on war seen from the perspective of an older woman who visits the battle front.",B
90,Blood and Tears: The Arab-Israeli Conflict,"'A small house can accommodate hundreds of friends, but can't accommodate two enemies,' the doctor says ruefully, quoting an Arab proverb. Sadly, Blood and Tears is the proof.",3.5/5
91,The Cool School,Morgan Neville's quick-paced documentary The Cool School recounts the rise and fall of Ferus Gallery and the mark it made on American art.,2.5/4
92,Pathology,"An intense, sexy medical thriller that gives us a glimpse of what CSI would look like if it were a horror.",7.5/10
93,Disney's A Christmas Carol,"A clear step in the right direction for Zemeckis and his pet techno-project, the film nonetheless ultimately sabotages itself by prizing the hectic over the heartfelt.",2/4
94,Deep Water,[An] expertly assembled and engrossing documentary.,3/5
95,Road to Victory,"... hopefully what I write might encourage someone to seek out a film. Such is the case with Road to Victory, the debut feature of writer-director-actor Mike Reilly.",B
96,Beverly Hills Chihuahua,Actually better than its premise and its trailer might lead you to expect.,3/5
97,Fireflies in the Garden,"The cast are uniformly good; it's all competent, but its somehow not completely satisfactory.",6/10
98,The Eye,"Dull, clichéd, and silly, this is yet another watered-down slice of horror cinema that will score big with teenage girls under the age of fifteen.",2/5
99,Day of the Dead,"No matter how you slice it, this one is just plain dead on arrival.",2/5
100,My Best Friend's Girl,"It's disturbing to think of the millions of teenage boys who will laugh when he insults a girl to get her in bed, or pees in a cactus plant at a restaurant.",2/5
101,The Burrowers,J.T Petty takes viewers on an unusual and frightening venture into the Old West with The Burrowers.,3.5/5
102,The Midnight Meat Train,"MEAT TRAIN is the first BOOK OF BLOOD to depart from the station in a long time and it's refreshing to see that the film carries that bleak, yet romantic touch of Clive Barker all over it... it's guaranteed to make you squirm, scream and beg for more!",7/10
103,The Lucky Ones,"Soldiers deserve a better tribute than this trite, phony dreck.",C-
104,Run Fatboy Run,Predictable sitcom but delightfully feel-goodish.,B
105,Closing Escrow,"Amid the laughs, the one thing Closing Escrow proves is this: It's a lot more fun watching other people trying to buy or sell a house than going through it yourself, particularly if Realtors like the ones here are involved.",4/5
106,Whiteout,The film's been sitting on the shelf for 2 1/2 years; maybe it went bad?,C
107,Randy and the Mob,It's a film brimming with individual scenes featuring nice visual touches about the South and comforting down-home dialogue spiced with a healthy twinge of sarcasm. Too bad the movie never completely gels.,C
108,Black Irish,The blarney isn't the only thing that's thick in writer-director Brad Gann's Black Irish.,2/4
109,Wild Child,"The movie falls apart when it tries to explain why Poppy's been sent to this school. And the Spartacus moment at her school ""trial"" for misconduct is so cringe-worthy you want to die.",6/10
110,Powder Blue,Few will remember Powder Blue as a desperate copy job of Paul Thomas Anderson's brilliant Magnolia but rather as the film where Jessica Biel finally took it all off.,1/4
111,King Corn,"An entertaining look at the flagship of American empty calories, King Corn is a few bushels short of being the next Super-Size Me, but brings a legitimate message.",7/10
112,L' Avocat de la Terreur (Terror's Advocate),"Schroeder's docu offers a chilly, poignant look at Verges, the controversial lawyer who has defended some of the world's biggest political terrorists and war criminals; it belongs in the same league of his other docus about monsters, like Idi Amin.",A-
113,Darfur Now,Its 99 minutes could have easily been about 65 if you removed all of the celebrity do-gooder filler.,2/4
114,Laaga Chunari Mein Daag - Journey of a Woman,"One can't help but sense an edgier, braver film fighting to break free.",2/4
115,Rails & Ties,"To describe the plot is to parody the film. Though impeccably acted and directed with a solemn, professional gloss, it sinks under the weight of its absurdity.",C
116,Mr. Untouchable,"Marc Levin may avoid outright idol-worship, but any restraint exhibited by his film is disingenuous.",2/4
117,House,"The only spiritual enlightenment I achieved was thinking ""Thank God that's over"" when the closing credits began to roll.",1/5
118,Canvas,Writer-director Joseph Greco's refusal to explain the roots of Mary's madness gives John's desperate desire to summon happier days a bewitching poignancy.,2.5/4
119,Skid Row,"...Skid Row too often comes to feel like a vanity project, with the focus of the film frequently shifting away from Skid Row's history and people to Pras's sketchy immersion in homelessness...",2/4
120,Saawariya,"When the most intriguing thing about a film is the production design, you know you're in trouble.",2/4
121,Aaja Nachle,"Aaja is genteel and winsome and directed with restraint. Some of the best dialogue in recent times, resting on a core of quietude.",3/4
122,Flawless,Cleverly written and brilliantly made ... the type of classy and tasteful British crime-drama that Caine has long been associated with.,8/10
123,What Happens in Vegas,"This tone-deaf flick from hack screenwriter Dana Fox, is an example of a Hollywood formula romantic comedy where the author never properly learned the recipe.",C-
124,Appaloosa,"Old fashioned Western, a meditation on honor, courage and camaraderie, is well helmed and acted, but commercially, it might fall between the cracks: It's too grown-up for young viewers and too familiar as a psychological Western for adults.",B
125,Good,"For Amorim, who only claims his second feature with Good, it's best to see the film as a next step towards honing the quality storytelling skills needed for making successful movies.",2.5/5
126,The Visitor,...rife with compelling figures that ultimately sustain the viewer's interest even through a few less-than-subtle moments.,3/4
127,Meet Bill,...basically entertaining yet entirely forgettable.,2.5/4
128,Married Life,You know you're in trouble if the wallpaper is more exciting than anything that happens in front of it.,1/5
129,Badland,"Clocking in at just under three hours, writer-director Francesco Lucente's earnest attempt at making an Iraq War-era Coming Home says many things at once without much perspective or clarity.",2.5/4
130,The Oxford Murders,"Not so terrible that you can understand why it's been practically buried by its distributors, but you can get better ridiculous whodunits on TV.",2/5
131,Untraceable,"The villain may be Untraceable, but it's easy to pin down the influences of Gregory Hoblit's serial killer snoozer.",1/4
132,The Informers,"An ugly, blank slate of a film, one that feels like a rough outline for one of the better Ellis adaptations.",1.5/5
133,Meeting Resistance,"As in Land Without Bread and The Bridge, Meeting Resistance raises all sorts of ethical questions about its making.",2.5/4
134,The Freshman,"The Freshman is a dawdling, occasionally amusing stunt.",B-
135,Guta-yubalja-deul (A Bloody Aria),Performers are convincing enough to keep audience involvement in a tale of revenge: victims become victimizers.,B
136,Kenny,The perfect antidote to any disappointing summer blockbuster.,4/5
137,The Rocker,"It's modestly entertaining, occasionally funny, and generally agreeable. I just don't think Wilson should quit his day job yet.",B-
138,The Perfect Holiday,Be grateful that Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut have the wherewithal to elevate a mediocre script.,2/4
139,La Graine et le Mulet (The Secret of the Grain) (Couscous),The film works on a slow burn but by the end it has become utterly engrossing.,4/5
140,Land of the Lost,"The movie's abbreviated title is LOL, which is ironic since Ferrell offers hardly a smile, much less laughter out loud.",D
141,[Rec],...this experience feels like being trapped in a haunted maze and there are images here that are the stuff of nightmares.,4/5
142,Look,A seamless mixture of riotous humor and socio-political commentary.,B+
143,And God Created Woman,Movies like this frustrate me because they do not have enough ambition to match their imagination.,2/4
144,The Box,"It may fall short of Donnie Darko's clever storytelling, but for his third feature film, Kelly plays confidently with suspense and lays down the right hooks at the right time to keep you drawn into his creepy world.",3.5/5
145,Man in the Chair,"As in Cocoon(1985), the emphasis is on sentiment, feel-good and reclaiming the elderly from the scrapheap. But the performances are nowhere near as subtle.",2/5
146,Undoing,"A smidgen of originality lies in its being a noir film with Korean characters: others nothing new, but still a watchable gangster pic.",B
147,Black Water,"There's something to be said for a chomp-em-up tale that exhibits some class, intensity, and restraint.",3.5/5
148,21,"In its desperation to deliver an action-packed suspense set piece of an ending, 21 asks the audience to suspend all disbelief, and basically begs to be laughed at.",C
149,The Duchess of Langeais (Ne Touchez Pas La Hache)(Don't Touch the Axe),"If you appreciate their acting, and enjoy the words of the battle between them - during which the duchess prevaricates until it is too late - it will seem fascinating.",3/5
150,Ben X,"Enriquecido ainda por uma direo de arte que ilustra a tristeza do universo de Ben, este  um projeto artisticamente ambicioso que revela sua sensibilidade particularmente atravs de seus belos dilogos.",5/5
151,Body of Lies,"DiCaprio (not Crowe) is in top form in Scott's fast-moving, visually vivid but dramatically uninvolving noirish geopolitical thriller that despite problems conveys the point that in the new war on terrorism information, not weaponry, is the key variable.",B
152,Passengers,Solely predicated on its twist ending.,1/4
153,The Grand,If you're a fan of watching poker on television and inventive comedy than The Grand is an entertaining experience that delivers on its premise.,9/10
154,The Hammer,It'll make you laugh enough so that you forget you've seen it all before.,3/5
155,Shutter,A dreary parade of the familiar...unrelentingly boring and needlessly unimaginative.,D+
156,Priest,Not terrible.,2.5/5
157,The Broken,"It's not a stalker flick or a ghost story, although it's sort of a combination of both.",4/5
158,The Escapist,Those looking for an innovative new take on the prison genre should be pleased with the latest from this talented filmmaker.,8.5/10
159,Sugar,"Directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden use Sugar's tale to draw attention to pertinent social and economic issues. Thankfully, they do so with a light touch and an immense feeling of sympathy for their characters.",3/5
160,Quid Pro Quo,"Has some pretty insightful things to say about the nature of being ""disabled,"" and it says them with a good deal of humor, style, and understanding.",3.5/5
161,Red,A simple tale of how love and affection can sometimes inspire some of the nastiest human emotions imaginable.,3.5/5
162,The Guitar,"To be brutally honest, there are many other things I would rather do with my final days than sit through this clichd mess all over again.",1.5/5
163,The Road,"Fortunately, the rumourmongers were wrong -- Hillcoat's vision is forthright and brutal.",4/5
164,G-Force,"G-Force has a script on autopilot, assuming that any old assortment of fart jokes, cheesy one-liners, and chase scenes will be enough to appease tots.",2/5
165,The Other Man,...pretty much cements Richard Eyre's status as a high-brow purveyor of trashy fare...,2.5/4
166,The Duchess,"It could have been an intriguing, poignant saga of a modern marriage and extraordinary femme, but what we get is a trashy melodrama that can't decide how sensationalistic to be",C+
167,The Women,"Piecemeal and earnest to a fault, this remake of George Cukor's 1939 film relies so much on the elite world of humorless, filthy rich New York women that it excludes most of its would-be target fans.",C-
168,Public Enemies,"Opinions will differ about Depp's iconic approach but this supremely mounted, painstakingly researched, well acted gangster epic is Michael Mann's most ambitious film since Heat, with insights about the mythic figure, law enforcement and broader contexts.",A-
169,Night and Day (Bam gua nat),A well-wrought Korean film about a middle-aged painter's infatuation with a pretty young art student.,3/5
170,Julia,"The film has the focused derangement of a suicide bomber...but I for one am elated to see such brazenness, such mystery, and such crazy, highwire ambition back in the movie theater.",A-
171,Angel and the Badman,Genteel Western.,C+
172,Fade to Black,"On paper this must have looked a neat idea: a wildly fictionalised account of a skid-row Orson Welles, up to his neck in political skulduggery while shooting a third-rate picture in post-war Italy.",2/5
173,Angel Heart,"Angel Heart is a thriller and a horror movie, but most of all it's an exuberant exercise in style, in which Parker and his actors have fun taking it to the limit.",3.5/4
174,Old Dogs,Trashing Old Dogs is a bit like kicking a puppy. But here goes.,1.5/4
175,Surrogates,a surprisingly strong entry into the ever-shrinking arena of serious sci-fi.,4/5
176,The Promotion,"Precise, clever, wonderfully strange, and so funny it hurts, it is simply the best studio comedy since The 40-Year Old Virgin.",A-
177,Notorious,"If there's something praiseworthy about Notorious, it's that it pulls off the remarkable, ignominious feat of making its deceased subject less likeable than one remembers.",1/4
178,Soul Men,Bernie Mac's last film before his untimely death is a let-it-rip irreverent comedy invested with Bernie's trademark brand of earthy humor.,A-
179,Igor,"John Cusack is the voice of Igor, a hunchbacked laboratory assistant to the doomed mad scientist Dr. Glickenstein (voiced by John Cleese), in this irresistible animated comedy",B
180,The Matador,fabulous,4/5
181,The Auteur,"If you don't mind a lot of smutty gags mixed with a strange concoction of wit, warmth, and (yes) melodrama, I'm betting you'll become a fan of The Auteur.",3.5/5
182,The Caller,Close but no cigar as a great international corporate mystery thriller slows to a crawl in a drawn out study of death. Frank Langella and Elliott Gould should have been used better.,6/10
183,Sin Nombre,"An honorable addition to border films about Central American immigrants, this highlight of the Sundance Film Fest offers visceral experience based on the helmer's firsthand familiarity.",B
184,Das Haus der Schlafenden Schönen (House of the Sleeping Beauties),"A meditation on life, death, sex, revenge, religion and peace that is involving despite its ponderous pace.",B
185,The Stone Angel,"These elemental forces fuel a compelling narrative, but the second half of the movie starts to drift.",2.5/4
186,Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel,What we're offered is a succession of lifeless scenes punctuated by pratfalls that only a handful of kids in the audience found funny. Next.,1/5
187,Un Conte de Noël (A Christmas Tale),There are no martyrs in this anti-sentimental ironic movie that nevertheless percolates with emotion and accepts its quirky characters for all of their flaws.,B+
188,The Rebound,An utterly predictable entrant in the Cougedy genre sees a yummy-mummy (Zeta-Jones) and her 25 year-old babysitter (Bartha) tumble into love after she takes her two young children to a new life in New York.,2.5/5
189,Ripple Effect,"Nothing more than an elongated soap opera, sans the self-awareness.",1/5
190,"1,000 Times Good Night","Ultimately it feels like Poppe wanted to say something about a great many topics...But what he concludes on any one of these points is never clear, so the film simply meanders...",C+
191,Harold,"The low-budget high-school comedy is no 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off' but should provide for not only laughs but some insight into the life of a smart, 13-year-old outsider.",B
192,Push,"A harrowing mindbender which successfully blends elements of X-Men, The Matrix and Memento while adding some of its own unique sci-fi flava.",3.5/4
193,Felon,Felon flounders in convincingly resolving its protagonist's plight.,2.5/4
194,Scar,Blood cascades out of the screen (Titanic - in red) when blades are not in your face. Desensitisation soon sets in: too like Halloween H20.,4/10
195,The Unborn,"Exactly what you'd expect from the combination of its release date, genre, and MPAA rating",C-
196,Bitch Slap,"In any other world, this would be getting a DVD or Syfy-only release, and Jacobson's talents would be better utilized directing Playboy Channel interstitials.",4/10
197,Forever Strong,"Adhering to the belief that action scenes are more thrilling when you can't tell what the hell is going on, the director gives us just the ""highlights.""",0.5/4
198,Chocolate,"It fails to be the exploitation movie it desperately wants to be. Too much attention is paid to the tear-jerking elements, which never register because the plot is so sparse.",43/100
199,Fireproof,"If you've never heard of ""Fireproof,"" that could mean you are not a member of a faith-based community. On the other hand, it just might mean that you haven't stumbled upon this new release that packed Quad-City theaters over the weekend.",3/4
200,Dostana,"This is a great, fun entertainer with lots of charm and great music.",7/10
201,The Garden,"It's tempting to call The Garden a story of innocence and experience, of evil corrupting paradise, but that would be doing a disservice to the fascinating complexities of a classic Los Angeles conflict and an excellent doc that does them full justice.",4/5
202,Splinter,"The creature feature is loaded with blood, guts, gore, the perfect anti-hero and a hilariously fun plot, which is played straight until the very end...Wilkins delivers a simple, yet effective '80s creature feature that's not only scary, but also a great t",7/10
203,Leaves of Grass,"...worth checking out if only for Norton's phenomenal, Oscar-worthy turn as the film's diametrically opposed twins.",3/4
204,Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (A Couple Made by God) (A Match Made in Heaven),"It's well put together, colourful, typifies Indian culture and values, is very emotional, and is a typically numbing 3 hours long. Ticks all the boxes then...",4/5

206,Gigantic,...inevitably grows on the viewer...,2.5/4
207,Fuel,... a rousing documentary on the real costs of petrochemical dependence and the practical alternatives within reach.,B+
208,Hush,Tonderai makes good use of soulless motorway catering venues - all white strip lighting and hunched zombie drivers - but overkills his tale with a succession of improbabilities.,4/10
209,Anna Karenina,One of Garbo's best and most affecting films.,4/5
210,Orphan,Orphan works because it's a film that knows exactly what it wants to be -- creepy as all get out -- and does everything possible to achieve that goal.,3.5/5
211,My Sister's Keeper,"Cameron Diaz gives a strong dramatic performance in Cassavetes family melodrama, which begins well with poignant probing of timely issues like social engineering before turning into conventional courtroom tale that deviates from the book considerably.",C+
212,The Hangover,"Miraculously, we still like Alan and Stu and Phil even as we crack up when they get tazed and beaten. Phillips has pulled off a feat of balance that rivals Cirque du Soleil down the Strip.",4/5
213,The Stepfather,"100 minutes of dopey behavior and filmmaking inanity wrapped up tight in a bland, gutless PG-13 wooby, taking a proven premise and watering it down to a parade of nonsense created only to tickle gullible teen audiences.",D
214,Okuribito (Departures),"Takita's serio-comic look at life, death, redemption and forgiveness, is Japan's entry for the Oscars, winning audience awards in festivals, which speak well of its potential commercial appeal outside Asia.",B+

220,An American Affair,The central relationship remains intriguing but the later parts of the film suffer from a routine conspiracy plot.,2.5/5
221,Grace,"Covers the three essential bases of indie horror: It's scary, it's smart, and it pushes a few boundaries. An excellent debut for Paul Solet.",4.5/5

230,The Messenger,A n intricate dual character study.,B
231,Lake Mungo,"As a ghost story, the underplaying of the actors helps to make the mystery creepily effective, but the mockumentary format is a bit of a cop-out because it allows the filmmaker to avoid all the big dramatic scenes.",3.5/5

249,Tron Legacy,"If you're a fan like me, it's worth seeing for both the nostalgia and the debate you're going to have after the film. If you're not, it's worth seeing for the visuals.",7/10

253,A Beautiful Life,This intertwined tale of people struggling on society's fringe plays like bad community theater.,0.5/4

261,Around the World in 80 Days,"It was definitely one of the biggest ""event"" films of the 1950s, but the decade produced many smaller films that were much more entertaining and that have aged better.",3/4
262,The Fall,"With The Fall, writer-director John Krueger buries a promising neo-noir plot with ponderous pacing and uneven performances and dialogue.",2/5
263,The Good Heart,"Although some of this is just too literal and the ending a bit unsatisfying in its obvious simplemindedness, The Good Heart is redeemed as a wonderful opportunity for memorable character studies.",3/5
264,Wonderful World,"Credit Broderick and the cast for putting across the fey Indiewood bullcrap with committed, nearly convincing effort.",2/5
265,Collapse,Smith's subject Michael Ruppert never registers as much more than an eloquent but largely untrustworthy quack.,2/4
266,Three Blind Mice,"Defies expectation. This is an unpredictable landscape populated by fully three-dimensional characters, and it's entirely entertaining. This is the world as men live in it.",3.5/5
267,The Last Song,It's not one of Sparks's more inventive efforts and Cyrus's extended sulk doesn't exactly enhance her acting prospects. Not that this means much.,1/5
268,Babies,"The new, original docu Babies assumes the shape of a sharply observed, highly visual cross-cultural anthropological exploration without in the least being didactic, academic or judgmental.",B

270,Going the Distance,"Manages to be interesting as well as amusing, and there are good performances from both Drew Barrymore and Justin Long at the core of it.",3.5/5
271,Life as We Know It,"It's rather cute and sweet, in a sickly sort of way. But that's no longer adequate.",2/5
272,The Final,"Wants to be ""Saw meets Heathers,"" I suspect. It doesn't succeed.",2/5
273,Frozen,[Writer/director Adam] Green has crafted a potent combination of absolute terror and compelling human drama that will stick with you long after you've left the theatre or turned off the DVD.,4.5/5
274,Prodigal Sons,"As director and leading subject, Kimberly Reed shares all sides of herself. She's sensible, sensitive and candid, and brilliantly establishes a tone of contemplative empathy and compassion.",4.5/5
275,The Ghost Writer,...an enjoyable if not satisfying experience.,B-
276,Repo Men,"If you aren't too repulsed by the general ultra-violence and horror aspects, you're in for some treats of the gross out variety that could send you reeling to the lobby.",4/5
277,7 Days (Les 7 jours du talion),"In directing this torture porn, Daniel Grou is intent on dismissing the doctor's oath, 'primum non nocere,' and he does that quite well.",B+
278,Daddy Longlegs,Seamlessly strung together with a funny-sad tenderness and a gliding casualness that's more purposeful and believable than the unrefined improvisations of most DIY cinema.,4/5
279,Veer,I didn't get bored in the first half; the second put me to sleep.,2/5
280,Winter's Bone,"Deserves to be the major commercial breakthrough for both director Debra Granik and Jennifer Lawrence, its luminous, moon-faced star.",4.5/5
281,The Kids Are All Right,"A crowd-pleasing, feel-good comedy for an era in which the very definition of ""family"" is fluid and in flux.",3/5
282,Lucky,"May not change your world view, but it's pretty interesting to see what happens after a middle-class family wins $314 million.",3/5
283,High School,destined to take its place among classics like HALF-BAKED and UP IN SMOKE,8/10
284,Stolen,Stolen reveals a filmmaking hand in need of a considerable amount of seasoning.,2/4
285,The Killing Jar,"Mark Young's bargain-basement thriller is as witless as the captor's motive; to paraphrase another well-dressed Madsen psycho, this little doggie barks, but it has no bite.",1/5
286,La MISSION,A dimly obvious coming-to-terms-with-my-gay-son melodrama.,1.5/4
287,Predators,For the most part Predators is B-grade fun in the best possible way.,3/5
288,Stonewall Uprising,"Stonewall Uprising deploys familiar PSA-cum-hate-crimes like the infamous ""Boys Beware"" with very little restraint in order to truly establish Stonewall's prehistory as a No M2M's Land.",2.5/4
289,The Oath,"The Oath does give the viewer something to think about, but the film is unsatisfying, raising questions and providing too few answers.",2.5/5
290,The Wild Hunt,First-time feature filmmaker Alexandre Franchi shoots the outdoors amazingly claustrophobically - an almost-oxymoric effect that contributes to the unsettling atmosphere of The Wild Hunt.,3.5/5
291,Arthur,"Even if Dudley Moore's performance weren't so darn funny, it would still be worth watching just for John Gielgud.",4.5/5
292,The Lottery,"Director Madeleine Sackler favors an agenda of advocacy over complexity, making The Lottery an effective, if unapologetically one-sided, piece of agitprop.",3/5
293,Assault on Precinct 13,"John Carpenter's third movie (two years before Halloween), and one of his best.",3.5/5
294,Asylum,A great little gothic horror anthology. Track this one down if you can!,4.5/5
295,Attack of the 50 Foot Woman,Old-school camp craziness of the tallest and most feminine variety.,3/5
296,Avenging Angel,Typical exploitation stuff. The B-level camp charm of the original is absent here.,1/5
297,The Aviator,"Astoundingly dull, The Aviator should be revisited purely by enthusiasts of its two leads or those looking for a visual sleep aid.",1/5
298,The Awakening,"Dry-as-dust ""possession"" fare.",1.5/5
299,Babes in Toyland,A disgrace to the memory of Laurel and Hardy and the Hal Roach original.,1/5
300,Bad Company,"An easy watch, except for the annoying demeanour of its lead character.",67/100
301,The Bad News Bears,Bad News Bears is one of those rare films that I loved as a child and I still love just as much as an adult.,4/4
302,The Bad Seed,Stagy pacing and a few woeful missteps can't change the fact that this is a creepified horror classic.,4.5/5
303,Bang The Drum Slowly,"It's a must-see for anyone, be they a fan of the grand old American pastime, or simply someone who likes being told a real classic human tale.",4/5

305,Beauty and The Beast (La Belle et la bête),One of the most magical of all films.,4/4

307,1001 Grams,...a special little film that's well worth seeking out.,3.5/4
308,The Best of Times,"Forgotten by most yet seemingly adored by those who choose to remember it, The Best of Times stands in my book as one of the truly great sports comedies.",4/5

312,The Big Heat,They don't get much better in noir films than this stark and gritty classic.,A
313,The Big Sleep,"The Big Sleep (1946) is one of Raymond Chandler's best hard-boiled detective mysteries transformed into a film noir, private detective film classic. This successful adaptation of Chandler's 1939 novel was from his first Philip Marlowe novel.",A
314,The Big Sleep,"The problem with the film, more than anything, is getting beyond the idea of it not being Bogie and Bacall up there on the screen.",4/5
315,Billy Budd,"Director Ustinov indulges his own performance, but otherwise, it's a great yarn well told.",3/5
316,The Birds,The Birds is a textbook exercise in taking a simple story and creating a devastating film.,4/5

323,Blackmail,Horrific and dated....worth seeing from a strictly historical standpoint.,0/5
324,Blind Date,"This is the kind of movie that serves as a reminder that comedy is agonizingly difficult when it works, and even more trouble when it doesn't.",2.5/4

331,The Boston Strangler,Pretty nasty stuff for its time.,3/5
332,The Bounty,"Despite its flaws, this is a film that looks great, includes a memorable Hopkins performance, and is well enough written to keep us thinking rather than latching onto stereotypes.",78/100

338,Brief Encounter,"Brief Encounter (1946) is director David Lean's brilliantly-crafted, classic British masterpiece. It is one of the greatest romantic tearjerkers/weepers of all time, with a very downbeat ending. Lean's film is a simple but realistically-honest...",A

354,Carny,"Carny is bursting with more information about American carnivals that it can contain, surrounding a plot too thin to support it.",2/4
355,Carrie,There is little suspense or dramatic tension; everything plays out like bad melodrama or cheap exploitation.,6/10
356,Casablanca,"This movie is like Hamlet in that, even if you haven't seen either one of them, you are probably familiar with much of the dialogue.",4/4
357,Casino Royale,"A big, flashy, unguided spoof that wanders around and bores you to sleep.",2/5

366,Charlotte's Web,"Especially giddy is Paul Lynde's wry Templeton the rat, whom I oddly still quote today.",4/5
367,The Chase,ripping little drama,4/5
368,Checking Out,The problem with Checking Out is that it provides us with fears we can understand and responses that seem to have been phoned in from a sitcom.,2/4
369,Children of the Corn,It just gets sillier and sillier with each passing year.,2/4
370,The Chosen,"Certainly, this is a gently evocative movie, with its glimpses of a strict and self-contained culture, and its memories of a time gone by.",3/5
371,A Christmas Carol,"Solid version of the story, but eclipsed by the 1951 film.",4/5
372,Christmas in Connecticut,"All in all, though, this is all very fluffy and silly and perfectly wonderful.",9/10
373,A Christmas Story,A Christmas Story's message is aimed at children and at the child in all of us for whom the Spirit of Christmas is alive and well.,4/4
374,Cimarron,"Critically lauded at the time of its release, Cimarron was beloved by most who saw it. Eight decades later, it is frequently cited on lists of the most undeserving Academy Award winners.",2/4
375,Cleopatra,"...not required viewing by any means, nor is it the bomb it is sometimes made out to be...",5/10
376,College,"The finale ties earlier elements together in a clever way, but the episodic film doesn't match the best of Keaton's films that establish a more cohesive storyline",B

378,Coma,So scary and so effective after all those years.,8/10

384,Creature from the Black Lagoon,A classic horror that warms the heart.,4/5

386,Cutting Class,"A D-grade slasher flick that has delusions of comedy and mystery, of interest only to those who lust after Brad Pitt and would love to check out a performance the actor would probably rather forget.",1.5/5
387,Damn Yankees,Why did and does Hollywood continue to put non-singers in musicals? No one in this movie has a good voice.,1.5/4

393,The Day the Earth Stood Still,Gort! Klaatu barada nikto.,B+
394,Days of Wine and Roses,"Days of Wine and Roses (1962) is the intense dramatic portrayal of an alcoholic, co-dependent couple. The film's poster describes its intriguing premise: ""It is Different. It is Daring. Most of All, in Its Own Terrifying Way, It is a Love Story.""",A

408,Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"Unable to explore the disturbingly misogynist undercurrents of the tale, the film is memorable mostly for the fine performances of the leads.",2.5/5
409,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"In the middle of a frantic Christmas season, there is no better respite from the buy-me commercialism of the holidays than this short, but poignant story by Dr. Seuss.",4/4

412,Dracula,Just doesn't fly.,2.5/5
413,Dragnet,It's fun a lot of the time. Several individual shots are hilarious.,3/4
414,The Dream Team,"This is not a bad starting place for a movie, but the filmmakers are unable to devise anything original for the patients to do once they've been set free.",2/4
415,Dressed to Kill,"a brilliant send-up of suspense and horror conventions that is, at the same time, extremely suspenseful and often vary scary",4/4
416,Duel,"Duel has come to represent much of what is ""wrong"" with the current cinema.",1.5/4
417,Dune,"Beyond the problems with central roles, the film's real trouble stems from the fact that Lynch just wasn't the right man for the job.",2/5

422,Edipo re (Oedipus Rex),"Slow-moving, sensual, and often gorgeous to behold.",2.5/4
423,The Elephant Man,"Understated and masterful in its use of costumes, makeup, and low-budget camerawork, David Lynch's portrait of John The Elephant Man Merrick stands as one of the best biographies on film.",4/5

462,Girls! Girls! Girls!,Those who remember Elvis as the King will shake their heads at this cheap production.,44/100
463,Gloria,[Gloria] is fun and engaging but slight. What saves this movie is Cassavetes' reliance on a tried-and-true plot construction.,3/4

488,Heaven,"Keaton's documentary is surprisingly light, bright and possessing of (a little) insight.",4/5

506,The Human Factor,"It remains a well-crafted but rather tedious effort, with only the sparkling performances from its outstanding cast giving the film some spark.",C

513,The Importance of Being Earnest,The most important and beloved version of the play,4/5
514,Impulse,"The movie is good to look at and painfully intense at times -- not so much when the plot is squeezing in, as when we're invited to identify with Russell when she's looking for trouble.",3/4

543,Jungle Book,The dialogue is fit for a jungle.,C+
544,Kansas,"The story and the values are so resolutely old-fashioned, and in such a formula way, that I was almost amused. If this movie had been made in the 1940s with Mickey Rooney, it would have felt just right.",2/4

555,The Ladykillers,a wonderfully macabre comedy,3.5/4
556,Laura,"Preminger's deft direction creates an elegant noirish tone, and he elicits near-perfect performances from everyone, even a pre-Horror Schlock Vincent Pryce.",9/10
557,Legend,"Like many recent sword and sorcery movies, it is so effective in rendering evil, so good at depicting the dire, bleak fates facing the heroes, that it's too dreary and gloomy for its own good.",2/4
558,Les Miserables,"The 1935 film is a powerful version, centering on the antagonism between Valjean and Javert - though the filmmakers had to jettison much of Victor Hugo's pages to set up this dynamic.",4/5

568,Little Women,"The third of nine adaptations of the film to date, the 1933 Little Women is nonetheless one of the better versions of the book, and it can be forgiven a lot due to its age and era.",3/5
569,Little Women,"If anything, it has hauled back much too briskly on the strings of the heart and has strained a few muscles in the process. Its consequent agony shows.",2.5/5

596,The Mechanic,The funny thing is that this sounds more interesting than it is.,2.5/4

637,Odd Man Out,"Reed, one of Britain's finest directors, made his name with this haunting, lyrical masterpiece about a doomed fugitive.",5/5
638,The Odessa File,Tightly plotted and for the most part pretty convincing Cold War thriller built around a typically muscular performance by Voight.,3/5
639,The Omen,The Omen manages to have its shocks look sensible and seem convincing.,B-
640,On the Beach,One of the most powerful anti-war films ever made.,87/100
641,On the Town,"Wonderful MGM musical; Kelly and Sinatra in top form; N.Y. scenery fantastic! music is good, too.",4/5
642,Only When I Laugh,Belabored Neil Simon script with Marsha Mason.,3/5
643,Our Town,today it seems quite dated in its theatrical clunkiness,2.5/4
644,Out of the Dark,"The identity of the murderer is a contrived surprise, and the editing is a little too cute for its own good.",2/5
645,The Out-of-Towners,"Even with the normally loveable Jack Lemmon as its star and a script from Neil Simon, it's a dreary bore.",60/100
646,The Parent Trap,Great production values... and a surprising sense of humor,3.5/5
647,The Party,"Sometimes agreeable improvised comedy, but it wears out its welcome.",3/5
648,Pennies From Heaven,How cynical can a musical be?,B+
649,Peter Pan,"Peter Pan may be a boy who refuses to grow up, but his movie is really one of Disney's most adult ""kids'"" films.",3/5

656,Pit and the Pendulum (The Pit and the Pendulum),Even Vincent Price has little to do,2.5/5
657,Planet of the Apes,"...an above-average science-fiction movie in spite of its contrived plot, stilted acting, forced allegory, and unconvincing makeup.",7/10
658,Point Blank,"Fascinating, harsh gangster epic from Boorman.",4/5
659,Pollyanna,It's so saccharine it's difficult to take seriously.,2/5
660,Poltergeist,"This is a film that tends to annoy, as if it had been more taut and consistent, it could have been far more exciting.",3/5
661,Popeye,"Altman's job was to convey the spirit of the old cartoons, not dish up some ultraslick Hollywood sitcom fodder. He gets the job done right.",8/10
662,The Poseidon Adventure,probably the best of Hollywood's seventies-style disaster hokum,2.5/4
663,Posse,One of the many sturdy Westerns that emerged from 1970s Hollywood sporting a chip on its shoulder.,3/4
664,The Postman Always Rings Twice,"The magic in the film is in the chemical reaction between Garfield and Lana, their performances are sizzling.",A
665,The Postman Always Rings Twice,Sexy and unnerving.,4/5
666,Power,"The movie seems to be asking us to walk out of the theater shaking our heads in disillusionment, but I was more puzzled than disillusioned.",2.5/4
667,Pride and Prejudice,"Sometimes Leonard gets the details wrong -- the costumes and sets seem more at home in a late Victorian setting than in Austen's early 19th century -- but the overall effect is truthful, transporting us to a world different from but related to our own.",77/100
668,The Prince and the Pauper,Fairly fun Flynn.,3/5
669,The Prisoner of Zenda,As much fun as a swashbuckler could hope to be.,5/5
670,The Prisoner,This could've been a fascinating look at the interplay between two very different men...but Bridget Boland's screenplay utilizes the most stilted dialogue imaginable.,1.5/4
671,The Producers,"It is moving to know that a film can be so entertaining, and almost a third of a century after its release, it still stands tall above almost every contemporary comedy and every pretentious twit who moans about films that 'have nothing to say'.",10/10
672,Project X,"It's content to be a well-made, intelligent entertainment aimed primarily, I imagine, at bright teenagers. It works on that level.",3/4
673,Prom Night,"Because it's quite easy to figure out the killer's identity by simply keeping track of who is off screen a lot, much of the movie is just vamping for time.",2/5
674,Promised Land,'Promised Land' squeaks by on the strength of its performances.,6/10
675,Prophecy,a dim-witted creature-feature that takes itself far too seriously,1.5/4
676,The Protector,"Jackie Chan beats up people and things blow up....If it's good enough for you, the picture works.",4/10
677,The Prowler,a better-than-expected entry into that most despised of genres,2.5/4
678,The Public Enemy,a cracklingly good vintage Cagney vehicle,4/5
679,Pulse,"Somewhere in between the second and third act, it takes a hard left turn into a field full of stupid. The remaining minutes feel rushed and generic",2/5
680,Quo Vadis?,Peter Ustinov's delightful over-the-top prissy performance was fun to watch.,C
681,A Raisin in the Sun,"The struggle to triumph in the face of adversity transcends the film being pegged as a civil rights picture, and thanks to the leadership of Poitier, a classic is born.",4/5
682,Raw Deal,This plot is so simple that perhaps the most amazing achievement of Raw Deal is its ability to screw it up. This movie didn't just happen to be a mess; the filmmakers had to work to make it so confusing.,1.5/4
683,The Razor's Edge,"Glossy, effective version of the Maugham novel.",4/5
684,The Razor's Edge,"""Don't write that book report to it, just enjoy its eccentricities.""",3/4
685,Rear Window,Masterpiece!,4/4
686,Reckless,"Foley's feature debut treads the familiar turf of defiant teenagers, basically a compilation of contrivances and cliches lifted out The Wild One (Brando), Rebel Without Cause (James Dean), and most recently, All the Right Moves (Tom Cruise).",C
687,Red Dawn,"Red-baiting pablum about some Brat Packers, here dubbed the Wolverines, who rescue Colorado from a Soviet occupation. Risibly bad, jingoistic, and often laughable to boot.",0/5
688,Red Heat,"""Red Heat"" is not the first movie about a couple of very different cops, and it will not be the last, but as the formula goes this is a superior example.",3/4
689,The Red Shoes,"If you love dance, and music, and movies, treat yourself this weekend to The Red Shoes.",A
690,Red Sonja,Incredibly stupid,0/4
691,Monanieba (Repentance),It's worth more for its daring political statement against the totalitarian Soviet regime of Stalin than as a work of moving satire.,B-
692,Return to Oz,"An underrated little romp, surprisingly faithful to L. Frank Baum's atmosphere... though obviously it's all overshadowed by that other Oz flick.",3/5
693,Revenge,"It combines the slick, high-tension filmmaking fashion of today with the values and sexual stereotyping of yesterday. It's such a good job of salesmanship that you have to stop and remind yourself you don't want any.",2.5/4
694,Rich and Famous,Entertaining remake of Old Acquaintance from the twilight of Cukor's career.,4/5
695,Risky Business,"Despite its dated feel, this film has an interesting premise, great style and good acting.",7/10
696,Road House,"This is not a good movie. But viewed in the right frame of mind, it is not a boring one, either.",2.5/4
697,Robin Hood,It's good for that time period from which the Disney studios were struggling to make good animated pictures.,3/4

699,Rock 'n' Roll High School,What punk rock lovin' fiend doesn't love the Ramones?,5/5
700,Rocky,The basic storyline has been done to death over the years; this is still one of the most effective and successful applications of the formula.,3.5/4
701,The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone,"The tagline says that they called it love and it was for sale, to which the appropriate response is that one hopes they kept the receipt.",1/4
702,Romeo and Juliet,"A more romantic and realistic rendition of the nature of love, I have never seen.",4/4
703,Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,The beauty of this film is that it was made before the hype that's surrounded both the holiday season and kids entertainment since the late 1970s.,77/100
704,Runaway,A weak s-f offering.,2/5
705,Running Scared,"This genre is so overpopulated that it hardly seems like we need one more example, and yet ""Running Scared"" transcends its dreary roots and turns out to be a lot of fun.",3/4
706,Sabotage,Perhaps the best of the thrillers Alfred Hitchcock made in Britain before coming to the States.,B
707,Sabrina,"All in all, Sabrina is an intelligent, mildly entertaining also-ran.",3/5

712,Scarface,"One of Hawks's undisputed masterpieces, and a landmark in the screen depiction of gangsters.",5/5

714,The Sea Hawk,Curtiz and Flynn at their apex,5/5
715,Blind Terror (See No Evil),...genuinely creepy.,3.5/4
716,Separate Tables,"A touching and absorbing movie that (thankfully) doesn't wrap everything up with a big, dumb, happy ending.",82/100
717,Shadow of a Doubt,"Not one of Hitchcock's best, but is still one of his most intriguing.",3.5/4
718,Shaft,"The attraction to them will be the stylish conversation and attitudes, as well as Richard Roundtree, who lends Shaft the right amount of charisma, swagger and untouchability.",4/5
719,The Shaggy Dog,A lost classic from a simpler time.,4/5
720,Shakedown,"It's an assembly of sensational moments, strung together by a plot that provides the excuses for amazing stunts, and not much else. But then not much else is needed.",3/4
721,Shall We Dance,One of the best Astaire-Rogers musicals with great music and dance.,4/5
722,The Shooting,"The film's ending is a favorite amongst cultists and it acts as the paradigm of Camus' thinking: stoic, but humane, and advocating nature over violence.",89/100
723,Short Circuit,Ideal for kids.,3/4
724,A Shot in the Dark,Classic Sellers. Hilarious from beginning to end; but only if you watch it drunk or at 3 AM,4/5
725,Show Boat,"Okay, but not a patch on the 1936 James Whale film.",3/5
726,"Silent Night, Deadly Night","This was obviously not new territory for the slasher genre, mind you, but Silent Night, Deadly Night brought the idea to new levels of cold sleaziness.",2/4

730,Sinbad the Sailor,It's a lush but humorless adventure tale about the mythical mariner and storyteller.,C+
731,Skin Deep,"There's wit, rudeness, satire, lust and pathos, all effortlessly rolled up together.",3/4
732,Sleeping Beauty,Viewing it again for the first time in five years is like being reunited with an old friend.,4/4
733,Something to Sing About,The higher rating for this low budget musical is for Cagney's great dance sequences.,4/5
734,Sorcerer,"Though not quite as brilliant as the French original, William Friedkin's tale of desperation and colonial exploitation still packs a merciless punch.",5/5
735,Sparkle,"It's a lousy movie, the kind where camp does not manage to equal fun.",1.5/5
736,Spartacus,[A] very attractive film because it doesn't lack spectacle.,6/10
737,Splash,Bizarrely overrated gimmick comedy,3/5
738,Spring Break,A movie in which leering and beer-drinking are everybody's favorite pursuits.,1/5
739,The Squeeze,"The Squeeze is a non-movie held together only by the intrinsic appeal of Michael Keaton and Rae Dawn Chong, its stars. They are given nothing to work with here. Nothing.",1/4
740,The St. Valentine's Day Massacre,"Shoot 'em up gangsters, Prohibition era, via Roger Corman.",4/5

742,Stage Fright,Stage Fright is hardly frightening.,B+
743,Stakeout,"Dreyfuss and his style are the two best things in ""Stakeout,"" a movie that consists of a good idea surrounded by a bad one.",3/4
744,A Star Is Born,A Star Is Born captures wonderfully the hustle of Hollywood.,4.5/5
745,A Star Is Born,"Judy Garland is at her peak, pulling out all the stops, daring the gods in this dark, weighty fable of the price one pays to be at the top.",5/5
746,A Star is Born,"It's Streisand's movie, and Streisand's character. Need I say more?",4/4
747,101 Dalmatians,"Dog-lovers, in particular, will go ga-ga for this, but this remarkably fresh and funny period tale (set in England, fact fans) has all the ebullience and lovability of its titular characters.",4/5
748,101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure,Makes the best of artistic limitations.,2.5/4
749,The Sting,"Magnificent, timeless stuff.",5/5
750,The Stranger,a solid piece of postwar genre work about a Nazi hiding in bucolic small-town America,3/4
751,A Streetcar Named Desire,"Thanks to the excellent text and superb actors, Kazan managed to create a very good film, but he still failed to turn it into genuine and everlasting masterpiece.",8/10
752,Suddenly,"What I liked best was that Frank [Sinatra] wore a fedora throughout, even indoors.",B-
753,Summer School,"A comedy so listless, leisurely and unspirited that it was an act of the will for me to care about it, even while I was watching it.",0.5/4
754,The Sundowners,"A splendid, sprawling saga of Australia.",4.5/5
755,The Sunshine Boys,"The movie itself is a bit lackluster (clever dialogue, but it really goes on and on and on...).",3/5
756,Suspect,"Suspect is a well-made thriller, but it was spoiled for me by an extraordinary closing scene where Cher, as the defense attorney, solves the case with all of the logic of a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat.",2.5/4
757,Suspicion,"The beauty of it is that it starts off light and charming, and darkens so gradually you won't even notice it shift from light romance into a psychological thriller.",79/100
758,Svengali,Movies this old seem to come from another planet.,55/100
759,Sweet Bird of Youth,"This cynical, coruscating drama has a strong look of being contrived, and Mr. Brooks' happy ending for it is implausible and absurd.",2/5
760,Swing Time,"Of all of the places the movies have created, one of the most magical and enduring is the universe of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.",4/4
761,Swiss Family Robinson,"It has atmosphere, wild animals, pirates, and most of all, an awe-inspiring sense of wonderment about creativity in general and about inventions in particular. Director Ken Annakin fashions an imaginative and special movie.",3/4
762,A Tale of Two Cities,"It's everything I expect from a Dickens adaptation: a grand, sweeping storyline; impeccable period costumes and sets; and colorful villains and selfless heroes.",3.5/5
763,The Taming of the Shrew,"Despite its blatant lack of political correctness, there is considerable fun to be had in this film.",76/100

770,That Championship Season,"It's hard to say that the picture is bad, just that it's dry as tinder without a spark to ignite it.",2/4
771,Them!,One of the better sci-fi'ers to emerge from the 1950s.,B
772,Shivers (They Came from Within) (The Parasite Murders),...the movie has a low-key immediacy to it that makes the perversions of its milieu all the more distressing.,A-
773,They Drive by Night,There's no denying that this overlooked 1940 gem is essentially two films in one.,3.5/4
774,Thief,"Good guys and bad guys have never been harder to peg, which is why Thief is so much fun, filled with nuance and subtlety not often found among caper flicks.",4.5/5
775,The Thing from Another World,Watching this movie one cannot help but marvel at what had passed as scary back in 1951.,2.5/5
776,The Thing,This is one of those rare remakes that remains faithful to the premise of the original but does something unique with the concept.,3/4
777,Thirst,"By focusing on [...] underground conspiracy, [director] Hardy and writer John Pinkney take Thirst away from the typical vampire movie [...]",3.5/5
778,This Gun for Hire,This is the film noir that made Alan Ladd a hot star after many years as a struggling actor.,B
779,Three Amigos!,"All great farces need a certain insane focus, an intensity that declares how important they are to themselves. This movie is too confident, too relaxed, too clever to be really funny.",1/4
780,Tre Fratelli (Three Brothers),"A touching, if sometimes downplayed portrait of grief framed by malcontent, Three Brothers remains a resonant late period master work from Francesco Rosi.",3.5/5
781,The Three Musketeers,"Colorful, figuratively and literally, MGM spectacle.",5/5
782,The Three Musketeers,Lester has crafted here the most inventive and wildly enjoyable version of The Three Musketeers ever committed to film.,4.5/5

786,Top Secret!,A must-see!,4.5/5
787,I corpi presentano tracce di violenza carnale (Torso) (Bodies Bear Traces of Carnal Violence),"So overloaded with red herrings that even Scandinavians would find it excessive, Torso is not the most complicated of whodunits.",3.5/5
788,Touch of Evil,"If this is not his greatest film, Touch of Evil certainly is among Welles' most entertaining.",88/100
789,Tough Guys,"Tough Guys might have been better if Douglas and Lancaster had played characters who were a little more fallible, humble and realistic.",2/4
790,Treasure Island,"Five minutes into the picture, I pretty much forgot about its 1934 production date and was caught up in the characters and story.",7/10
791,Treasure Island,"While the movie seems shorter every time I watch it (ninety-six minutes) and leaves out a lot of Stevenson's detail, its cheerful sense of excitement carries the day.",7/10

796,Uncommon Valor,Supremely entertaining.,3/4

801,Venom,"Pretty darn funny, but I don't think that was the idea.",2/5
802,Vice Versa,"Vice Versa is a treasure of a movie, in which the performances hold the key. It's a movie that finds its humor in many small moments of truth and accurate observation",3.5/4
803,Victory,"Huston, showing admirable range in his old age, creates enough on-field magic and nostalgia for the beatiful game as an idyll of now-extinct sportsmanship.",3/5

805,Walking Tall,"Overbearing, immensely popular pro-vigilante drama.",2/5

815,A Woman's Face,Pleasing film despite the inane dialogue.,B-

829,Conquest,"Though not one of Grabo's best film, the historical romance about Napoleon and Polish Countess Walewska is made in the classy middlebrow mode of MGM in the 1930s. Boyer received his first Best Actor Oscar nomination.",B
830,Alice in Wonderland,"It might not come close to a 5-star Disney Classic, but the breezy animation and colorful characters salvage an annoyingly fractured narrative.",3.5/5
831,My Blue Heaven,One of Steve Martin's most memorably amusing performances.,4/5
832,State Fair,"Rodgers and hammerstein's songs are great, but this musical version of the 1933 Will Rogers' vehicle is poorly directed by Walter Wang and poorly acted by Jeanne Crain, whose voice is dubbed by Louanne Hogan.",3/5

836,"Goodbye, Mr. Chips","In many ways better than the 1939 film, this beautifully made movie is hurt by being a musical with indifferent songs.",4/5
837,102 Dalmatians,Given the level of violence (however cartoonish) ... I'd question the wisdom of the MPAA in granting the movie a 'G' rating.,4/10

839,Narrow Margin,"The Idiot Plot, of course, is any plot that would be resolved in five minutes if everyone in the story were not an idiot. And rarely has there been a film in which more idiots make more mistakes than in this one.",1.5/4
840,Red Dust,"Gable and Harlow sizzle, and she looks great in a barrel.",3/5
841,Desperate Hours,"Desperate Hours is an attempt to take a 1950s crime classic and remake it by turning up the heat, but Cimino has set the heat too high, and the result is an overwrought melodrama with dialogue even a True Detective editor would question.",2/4
842,Ghost,"Contains some nice ideas, and occasionally, for whole moments at a time, succeeds in evoking the mysteries that it toys with.",2.5/4
843,Memphis Belle,"This human element in the experience of the Memphis Belle crew somehow compensates for a lack of human dimension in the characters. We can't really tell the crew members apart, and don't much care to, but we can identify with them.",3/4

856,After Hours,This is the work of a master filmmaker who controls his effects so skillfully that I was drained by this film.,4/4
857,White Fang,"The movie is magnificently photographed on location. The performances are authentic and understated, and Brandauer makes a convincing veteran prospector, part hard-bitten, part dreamer.",3/4

859,Mata Hari,A glamourous and romantic conception of the latter days of the life of the Dutch dancer and courtesan who was shot as a spy by the French in 1917.,3.5/5
860,Alice,"Very nice and harmless, if that's what you look for in a film.",2/5
861,Hidden Agenda,"The film is a bit slow and at times slightly strained, and there are moments when you'll be hard-pressed to understand all the dialogue -- but on the whole it is effective and chilling.",3/4
862,The Connection,"Though now hailed as trailblazer for alternative cinema, at the time, Clarke's experimental work about heroin junkies, was so controversial that it was banned for a year due to its ""foul"" language.",3/4

866,Diabolique (Les Diaboliques),It has the look and feel of one of the original Hitchcock movies from the 30s.,2.5/4
867,True Colors,Requires more than the willing suspension of disbelief; it demands a willful abandonment of incredulity.,2/4
868,Switch,"Switch has an intriguing premise and a terrific performance by Barkin, But it fails to really deliver on its promise.",2.5/4
869,The Field,"The Field is a grim allegory of hard life on the land -- a symbolic play, transplanted uneasily to the greater realism of the film medium, where what we might accept on the stage now looks contrived and artificial.",1/4
870,Oscar,The charm of this film lay in the talents of the supporting characters.,2/5

873,Possessed,Too heavy with German stimmung.,B-
874,Born to Kill,A revolting B film noir...,C
875,Toy Soldiers,"Toy Soldiers, a film with earnest performances and professional production values, is constructed out of characters, situations and gimmicks that will be instantly recognized by the weary viewer. There is nothing new here.",1/4
876,Come and See (Idi i smotri),"Come and See succeeds through its use of nightmarish un-reality -- how we might see these events not through a documentary objectivity, but through an uncomprehending gaze of horror.",3.5/4
877,The Miracle,The Miracle has so much poetic-nattering-by-the-Irish-seaside that the movie keeps drifting into the stratosphere. Jordan should come back down to earth. He does much better there.,C-
878,Hot Shots!,"Doesn't acheive ""Airplane!"" (or even ""Top Secret!"") status, but there are more than enough chuckles to warrant a recommendation.",3.5/5

881,Teacher's Pet,...breezy and likeable.,3/4

883,Romeo and Juliet,"Dated, dated, dated...and it has been done better since.",3/5
884,The Doctor,"In the wrong hands, this material could have been simply a cautionary tale, but Hurt and his director, Randa Haines, who also collaborated on Children of a Lesser God, make it into the story of a specific, flawed, fascinating human being.",3.5/4
885,Paradise,"The plot machinery creaks in Paradise, and it grinds exceedingly slow, and finally what it produces is a nice little movie about two children, and a contrived big movie about two adults.",2/4
886,The Commitments,"The musical choices are perfect, they are performed thrillingly and the audience will quite probably be dancing in movie theater aisles before it's over.",3/4
887,Frankie & Johnny,Any discomfort it may cause is a tribute to the truth it speaks about this crazy thing called love.,3/5
888,Deceived,"Deceived opens with an ancient thriller formula, elevates itself to passages of genuine suspense, and then ends with a climax so absurd that it takes a real effort of memory to recall that parts of the movie were really pretty good.",2/4
889,The Star,"A threadbare, bargain-basement Sunset Boulevard.",2/4
890,Poison,"What's truly revolutionary about this filmmaker -- his perverse, ironic humanity -- is only intermittently on display in this quasi-provocative formalist knickknack",B-
891,Cape Fear,"Proves that when a maverick virtuoso like Scorsese sets his mind to it, making ''mainstream'' movies is one more thing he can do better than just about anyone else.",A
892,Homo Faber (Voyager),"Voyager starts in mystery, and intrigues us. It continues with intelligence, and absorbs us. And then it ends in melodrama, and disappoints us.",3/4
893,My Girl,The beauty in this film is in its directness. There are some obligatory scenes. But there are also some very original and touching ones. This is a movie that has its heart in the right place.,3.5/4
894,JFK,Hypnotically watchable.,4/4
895,The Man in the Moon,"This cast is a knock-out. As the parents, veterans Sam Waterston, Tess Harper and Gail Strickland lead these novice teen actors in setting standards that these young performers will spend the rest of their careers trying to emulate.",3/5
896,The Prize,The only prize this film takes is the booby prize for crudeness.,C-
897,The Train,"How do you weigh the cultural heritage of a nation against the value of human life? A wholly persuasive, intelligent thiller crisply directed by Frankenheimer.",A
898,Father of the Bride,"This feel-good finale might feel even better, though, if it had any true connection to the pat, amiable, and rather dawdling farce that preceded it.",B-
899,Rush,"The movie depends on two strong performances for its effects, and gets them from Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh.",3/4
900,Medicine Man,"All of the elements are here for a movie I would probably enjoy very much, but somehow they never come together.",1.5/4
901,Platinum Blonde,Early Capra screwball comedy appealing to Depression audiences both as escapist entertainment and as satire of the idle rich and celebration of the hardworking poor.,B

905,Tacones Lejanos (High Heels),"Pedro Almodovar's films are an acquired taste, and with High Heels I am at last beginning to acquire it.",3/4
906,The Babe,"I really pretty much liked The Babe, despite its shortcomings, it's entertaining throughout, and Goodman, in his first starring dramatic role, is great.",3.5/5
907,The Cutting Edge,Certainly almost every aspect of the plot seems preprogrammed; the movie is like a series of compulsory exercises.,2/4
908,Gladiator,The idea of the Dennehy's illegal boxing arena is a storytelling masterstroke; it explains the small crowds at the same time it permits the boxers to fight dirty.,3/4
909,Kid Galahad,Solid Warners boxing yarn - you can't go wrong with Eddie G. and Bette.,4/5
910,Deep Cover,"What sets Deep Cover apart is its sense of good and evil, the way it has the Fishburne character agonize over the moral decisions he has to make.",3.5/4
911,All I Want for Christmas,All I want for Christmas is to never see All I Want for Christmas again.,0.5/4
912,Class Act,"Class Act takes a fairly radical idea and turns it into a sitcom, although not without giving us some idea of the possibilities it has missed.",2/4
913,Edward II,"Weird, fascinating, and not for everyone",4/5
914,A Midnight Clear,"...It's a good film, and Gordon is uncanny in the way he suggests the eerie forest mysteries that permeate all of the action.",3/4
915,Boomerang,"A witless, sexist, offensive mishmash that is surprisingly inept, considering all the high-power talent involved.",1/4
916,Rapid Fire,"As for the movie, the makers of Casablanca can sleep peacefully. Come to think of it, so can the makers of Ernest Scared Stupid.",1/4

923,Conquest of Space,"Conquest, no; a lot of Space, yes",1/5
924,Wind,"The real reason to see this movie, though, is because it makes a big yacht race seem so glorious, such grand adventure. Ballard is a former cinematographer with a knack for visualizing the outdoors.",3/4

926,Consenting Adults,Dreary suburban thriller.,2/5
927,Husbands and Wives,Husbands and Wives comes close to the exquisite stuff of art.,4/5
928,Hero,"A little more zip, and Hero might really have worked. It has all the ingredients for a terrific entertainment, but it lingers over the kinds of details that belong in a different kind of movie.",2/4
929,"Ned Kelly (Ned Kelly, Outlaw)",This film is worth seeing for those who want to see what Mick Jagger looks like when sporting an Abe Lincoln beard.,C-
930,Hallelujah,"Vidor elicited performances from the group as good as any you might see in a seasoned troupe. Even today, more than half a century later, this film is not dated.",4/5
931,The Sea Wolf,Fine Warners/E.G. Robinson sea faring action tale.,4/5
932,Forever Young,"Because the movie seems divided about its real subject, it lacks the kind of emotional momentum it needs for its final scenes.",2.5/4
933,Matinee,A delightful comedy and one of the most charming movies in a long time.,3.5/4
934,Unforgiven,"Enjoy it for the handsome wide-screen vistas, the interplay of the actors, the classical sweep of its story line. Just don't expect the new, soul-searching Eastwood to be any more dramatically convincing than the old.",B
935,Leap of Faith,"The movie itself has considerable qualities, among them Martin's performance as Nightengale. This isn't the sleek, groomed, prosperous Steve Martin we've seen in movies like L.A. Story. It's Martin as a seedy, desperate, bright, greedy man without hope.",3/4

937,Love on the Run,Charming romantic comedy with the stars at their peak.,4/5

939,Nowhere to Run,If you don't expect much (and the developer vs. land owner plot is ridiculous) you may be surprised at what's here.,2.5/5
940,Sniper,"Sniper expresses a cool competence that is a pleasure to watch. It isn't a particularly original film, but what it does, it does well.",3/4
941,The Vanishing,The first movie was existential in its merciless unfolding. This one turns into a slasher movie with a cheap joke at the end.,1/4

944,Indian Summer,This is a story more interested in tone and mood than in big plot points.,3/4
945,Alive,"The location photography is impressive, the scenery is awesome, the re-enactment of the air crash is terrifying and uses convincing special effects. We care about the characters while we watch the movie. But at the end it all seems elusive.",2.5/4
946,Point of No Return (The Assassin),"Point of No Return is actually a fairly effective and faithful adaptation [of La Femme Nikita], and Bridget Fonda manages the wild identity-swings of her role with intensity and conviction.",3/4
947,Brother's Keeper,"Brother's Keeper, the year's best documentary, has an impact and immediacy that most fiction films can only envy.",4/4
948,Born Yesterday,There's little (if anything) to recommend this movie.,1.5/4
949,Stalker,"More obviously a metaphorical construct than Tarkovsky's Solaris, and as a result, a bit less emotionally satisfying.",3.5/4
950,The Browning Version,"The schoolmaster to whom our pity is drawn is a pretty weak and lukewarm individual, hardly fit to be a teacher of growing boys -- even a teacher of classical languages, which he is.",2/5

952,Made in America,"This isn't a great movie, but it sure is a nice one.",3/4
953,Cliffhanger,"With its absurd story and even more absurd action set pieces, Cliffhanger's over-the-top (pun intended again) thrills and cheesy one-liners keeps this no-brainer action flick fun and watchable.",3/5

958,Gypsy,FineTV production of Merman vehicle with Divine Bette in great form.,5/5
959,Wide Sargasso Sea,"The hothouse atmosphere permeates every scene, creating an unhealthy climate in which young love is perverted, promises become lies, and jealousy is the strongest emotion.",3.5/4
960,The Secret Garden,"The movie is earnest, heartfelt, and, for all its lavishness, rather plodding.",C+
961,Strictly Ballroom,The true weirdness of the movie comes when we begin to realize the director didn't make everything up; only real life could possibly have inspired a world this bizarre.,3/4

969,High Noon,"Not a frame is wasted in this taut, superbly directed, masterfully acted film.",5/5
970,A Home of Our Own,"This situation, set in the 1950s, could be the set-up for a sitcom, or a retread of an old Disney family yarn. It ends up being a lot more, partly because Kathy Bates brings a solid, no-nonsense clarity to what could have been a marshmallow role.",3/4

975,The Skin Game,"Mr. Galsworthy's narrative is bound to enlist one's attention, but Mr. Hitchcock, who is responsible for the adaptation as well as the direction, cannot be said to have accomplished either task in a fashion the subject deserves.",2/5
976,The Man Who Loved Women,The Man Who Loved Women is not merely a film that hasn't aged well; it was stale six months after it was released.,42/100
977,Impact,If in the hands of a more exciting director this could have been top-grade film noir.,B
978,Into the West,"The bare story itself could be simplistic and silly: Cops chasing a couple of kids on a horse. But when relationships are involved, and social realities, and a certain level of magical realism, then the story grows and deepens until it really involves us.",3.5/4
979,The Three Musketeers,"It must have been great fun to make it (what young actor doesn't want to dash around on horseback and engage in swashbuckling swordfights?), but it's not that much fun to watch. It's all sound and energy, without plan or meaning.",2/4

988,Sugar Hill,"_As a message movie, ""Sugar Hill"" is perhaps no better or worse than most. It can be credited for striving to be more, but striving is not the same thing as being. Snipes deserves a better vehicle than this, but then, one suspects he picked it off the sho",C

1066,The Hill,"The Hill is tense, it's exciting, it's suspenseful, it's everything a good action picture should be, + it adds a healthy dose of realism and thought.",7/10

1068,Dead Man Walking,It will send you home with more than a few long thoughts.,3/4
1069,"Cry, the Beloved Country","We go expecting to be inspired and uplifted, and we leave somewhat satisfied in those areas, but with reluctant questions about how well the story has aged, and how relevant it is today.",2.5/4
1070,Georgia,"Georgia is not a simply plotted movie about descent and recovery, but a complex, deeply knowledgeable story about how alcoholism and mental illness really are family diseases.",3.5/4
1071,Wuthering Heights,"All in all, I still think Luis Buuel's 1954 Mexican version is the best I've seen.",3.5/5
1072,Broken Arrow,"Directed with the keen action instincts Woo brought to The Killer, Hard-Boiled and other cult causes from his career in Hong Kong.",3/4
1073,Restoration,"Somewhere in this potentially fascinating story of a man's life, the director caught epic fever and his characters got buried in breadth and depth of his ambition.",2/4

1075,Screamers,"Screamers is inundated with movie cliches, stock characters, stolen premises and scenes that just don't make sense.",1/4
1076,Othello,"... Will not give its viewers much of an idea of the Shakespeare play, and may inadvertently give them other ideas, about interracial love, that were not much on Shakespeare's mind.",2/4
1077,The Substitute,Settles for being a deranged version of The A-Team meets The Principal.,2.5/5
1078,Diabolique,"The husband is still a brute, and the swimming pool is still moldy, but the new Diabolique fails to translate into anything more than the latest ham-handed Hollywood makeover of a European classic.",2/4
1079,Before and After,fares poorly when constrained to the screen,2.5/5
1080,The Old Man and the Sea,Tracy reading Hemingway's lines...brings to them a simple dignity and nobility that is hard to match.,7/10
1081,The Convent (O Convento),"Always literate, visually appealing, and soulful... .",B+
1082,Carried Away,"Everyone in the film -- even the teenager -- is more intelligent and articulate than is usually permitted in American movies, and having gotten themselves into an emotional tangle, they go to work getting themselves out again.",3/4
1083,The Quest,"A speedy and rousing adventure, chock-full of exciting -- if unlikely -- events and swarming with colorful characters in colorful locations.",3/5
1084,Flipper,"Like the original 1963 movie and the TV series, it expects us to be endlessly amused by a dolphin that does things that are endless but not amusing.",2/4
1085,Primal Fear,"As a forum for its actors and for the big-screen directorial debut of multi-Emmy winner Gregory Hoblit, the film is up to the job.",3/4
1086,Twister,A summer crowd-pleaser worthy of its wind.,3.5/4
1087,Fear,"For a while, the cast is appealing enough, and the design is House Beautiful enough, to camouflage the Fatal flaws that turn the second half into an overblown, predictable snicker-fest.",2/4
1088,The Arrival,[Sheen] spends most of the movie in a kind of sweaty apoplexy that makes one worry for his health.,D
1089,Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre,"Jane Eyre with William Hurt as Rochester sounds dicey enough, but the last thing you expect from Zeffirelli's latest is a Jane without juice.",2/4
1090,Last Dance,"If this is a dance, the band has left the stand, and the bus boys are already mopping up melted ice.",2/4
1091,Moll Flanders,"The film's melodramatic ending sorts everything out in the approved style of the genre, but the movie is really better than that, a portrait of a woman who endures, thinks, and survives.",3/4
1092,The Last Supper,"All the courses are here and so are the nutrients, but The Last Supper, nevertheless, is a less-than-satisfying meal.",2/5
1093,Cold Comfort Farm,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Cold Comfort Farm"" when I watched it, but the minute I left the theater I remembered nothing about it.",3.5/4
1094,Independence Day,Independence Day is woefully short on anything that rouses the imagination.,4/10

1097,Matilda,The adult performers fare considerably better than the young lead in this faithful adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic.,2.5/4
1098,The Island of Dr. Moreau,"The movie keeps switching focus without ever getting its bearings, and when Brando exits earlier than expected, there's little but mayhem to fall back on.",2/4
1099,The Struggle,"Today it's best viewed as a fascinating curio, brought down by its wooden acting and grim, hokey tale of woe.",C
1100,A Time to Kill,"The performances are strong, the issues provocative. I was glad I saw it, but I was also glad when it was over; my chest was sore from Schumacher aiming wallops at my heart. Sometimes he connected, but I wished he'd aimed more often at my brain.",3/5
1101,Kingpin,"Some of the gags don't work, and yet I laughed at the Farrellys' audacity in trying them. And the humor isn't just gags and punch lines, but one accomplished comic performance after another.",3.5/4

1104,The Dentist,Icky slasher featuring some horrifying dental techniques.,2/5
1105,Alaska,"Beautiful vistas, Thora Birch and a cute bear can't compensate for the routine story and sloppy direction of this old-fashioned family adventure about the courageous efforts of two children to find their missing father.",2/5
1106,Jack,Someone deserves a timeout for letting this mawkish misfire get to the screen.,1.5/4
1107,Freeway,"A wild, audacious drive-in attraction that takes the 'high' from 'highbrow' and the 'low' from 'lowdown' and shakes them up.",4/4

1110,Harriet the Spy,...doesn't live up to its promise as a movie that could have had a lot of fun exploiting the ingenuity-themed construct.,2/5
1111,House Arrest,"Mostly, we get a string of tame set-pieces, one-dimensional characterizations, odd continuity gaps, and heavy-handed attempts at feel-good sentiment.",2/5

1115,The Associate,"If you were expecting Mrs. Doubtfire in reverse, invest your interest elsewhere.",2/4
1116,Emma,"Emma lacks the depth of passion present in the other Austen films, but, in large part because it's trying for something lighter and breezier, it's still fun.",3/4
1117,Les Visiteurs (The Visitors ),"I didn't find it very funny, but then I didn't find Black Sheep or The Cable Guy very funny, either, so maybe the problem is with me or, more likely, maybe all three films need to be sealed into capsules and shot into space.",2/4
1118,Selena,Why create a film biography so generic that it serves only to trivialize its subject and posthumously extend the celebrity-packaging process?,2.5/5
1119,Lone Star,"Sayles has surrounded his hero with other, more interesting characters and has warmed Lone Star with the glow of a humanist optimism rare in contemporary movies.",B+
1120,101 Dalmatians,"This is not one of the great Disney classics -- it's not in the same league with Snow White or Pinocchio -- but it's passable fun, and will entertain its target family audiences.",3/4
1121,Ransom,"There are a lot of thrilling moments in Ransom, but the film that connects them can't quite live up to the exiting highs.",3/4
1122,Scream,"Poised on the knife edge between parody and homage, Wes Craven's Scream is a deft, funny, shrewdly unsettling tribute to such slasher-exploitation thrillers as Terror Train, New Year's Evil, and Craven's own A Nightmare on Elm Street.",A-
1123,One Fine Day,Our whole family loved it.,2.5/4
1124,Michael,Fatally earthbound.,1.5/4
1125,In Love and War,"In Love and War is not much interested in Ernest Hemingway's subsequent life and career, and even in its treatment of this early period, it doesn't deal with themes such as his macho posturing, his need to prove himself, his grandiosity.",2/4
1126,Turbulence,Howlingly awful Die Hard retread.,2/10
1127,Touch,The experience of seeing the film is subduing; the movie plays in a muted key.,2.5/4

1129,The Crucible,"Ryder, usually a soft, placid actress, unleashes a bold new anger here.",A
1130,That Darn Cat,"The script trips all over itself to be hip and flip before it takes a desperate dip into utter conventionality: dull car chases, explosions, inept slapstick.",2/4

1132,Private Parts,Howard's film raises comedy to a new level.,4/4
1133,Mother,"Mother is shrewd, funny, and sweetly engaging; it's the first film Brooks has made that may even bring a tear to your eye.",B+

1137,Anna Karenina,"Like its opening, Leo Tolstoy's Anna Karenina is half-successful.",2.5/5
1138,Get Carter,"Filled with low-budget action and low-budget eroticism, Michael Caine unfortunately does not make much of an impression as a rough-and-tumble gangster.",2.5/5
1139,Traveller,"Thanks to rich characterizations and a strong cast, this is one story of con men in which the ""men"" are more important than the ""con.""",7/10
1140,Batman & Robin,This is the fourth in the gigantic film series and the second from director Joel Schumacher. It's also the fourth worst in the series (and second worst from Joel).,2/5

1147,Jack Frost,"Despite the snowman rape scene, this is not a fun B-movie. Nothing clever about it.",1/5
1148,George of the Jungle,"Depending on your point of view, this film is either truly awful or so bad it is good. In either case, be warned that a little of this repetitive movie can go a long way.",2.5/4
1149,Contact,"Carl Sagan's ode to the superior intelligence of aliens (and how us darned humans mess everything up) is consistently beautiful and interesting, but it never makes a point (except for that bit about the darned humans).",3.5/5
1150,Buddy,"Stifled by quaint Masterpiece Theatre-for-tykes pretensions, Buddy only comes alive when its quartet of real-life chimps go ape.",2/4
1151,Hoodlum,"The Sting-like ending with its crosses and double-crosses could have been better handled, but there are plenty of other payoffs.",3/4
1152,Steel,"The concept may not be bad, but there are times when the execution borders on embarassing.",2/4
1153,Fire Down Below,"Not a very good film, but it does offer a few pleasant surprises, and I was not expecting that from a Steven Seagal flick.",5/10
1154,Bliss,"My favorite exchange--Joseph: 'I can't come!' Maria: 'Too bad, MOTHERF**KER!'",1.5/4
1155,Picture Perfect,There are times when a bad ending doesn't seriously damage a motion picture. This is not one of those.,2.5/4
1156,Shall We Dance? (Shall We Dansu?),Masayuki Suo's direction combines the psychological and intriguing with comedy bits that might be found in a lesser movie.,3.5/4
1157,The Game,"The Game is an intensely exciting puzzle-gimmick thriller, the kind of movie that lets you know from the start that it's slyly aware of its own absurdity (which is why it can then get away with it).",B+
1158,Most Wanted,"The good news is that he infuses the potentially dry, formulaic plot with comedy. The bad news is that it's a by-the-numbers production.",C+
1159,The Keeper,Lacks insight though it's full of psychological implications.,C
1160,The Assignment,"A film of real finesse, style and intelligence, an espionage thriller of the old school, with some modern technical embellishments.",3/4
1161,The Peacemaker,"A sturdy, entertaining popcorn movie.",3/4
1162,No Way Out,"No Way Out borrows the template for socially conscious filmmaking from both Gentlemen's Agreement and Crossfire: it's half noir, half sermon.",2.5/4
1163,Seven Years in Tibet,"One of the season's more substantial large-scale entertainments, using colorful storytelling and Pitt's appealing presence to spotlight an imperialistic event that continues to cry for correction.",3/4
1164,One Night Stand,"The performances are all fine; it's the writer, composer, and director -- Mike Figgis all -- that spoil the show.",2/4
1165,Anastasia,A visually rich and extremely well-constructed story which shows a little nerve.,8/10
1166,12 Angry Men,This remake is worth viewing for the strength of the script and the fine performances.,3/4
1167,Firestorm,This film isn't apt to light your fire and it's doubtful it will ignite much action at the box-office.,1/4
1168,The Killers,The cast is excellent and Siodmak's direction is hard-edged and moody.,5/5
1169,Requiem for a Heavyweight,An all-time classic with Quinn giving one of the finest portrayals of his career. Gleason and Mickey Rooney are great in support.,5/5
1170,The Rainmaker,"You'll probably guess most of the twists in the story, but you'll have fun watching them anyway. Voight's reptilian performance alone is worth the price of admission.",3/4
1171,Fallen,Unfortunately the film wafts toward Seven turf soon afterward and stalls on a heavy burden of metaphysical chitchat. Washington's dazzling good looks are the only reason to stick with it.,1/4
1172,Fall,Fall leans too heavily in the direction of vain and smug.,1.5/5
1173,Great Expectations,"The film is a successful translation of the basic material from one period and approach to another. Especially in the early Florida scenes, it seems timeless.",3/4
1174,The Borrowers,"a touch of Dickens, a spritz of Rube Goldberg, and a dash of Monty Python",2.5/4
1175,Senseless,"Senseless is a Jim Carrey movie fighting to be a Penelope Spheeris movie, and losing.",2.5/4
1176,Merlin,"A nifty, loose-limbed epic miniseries: Sam Neill's last starring role?",4/5
1177,The Man in the Iron Mask,Features acting which is beyond reproach.,3/4
1178,Mr. Nice Guy (Yat goh hiu yan),Sub-standard Jackie Chan fare.,2/4
1179,Nightwatch,The so-called mystery is so incredibly predictable.,2/4
1180,Wide Awake,There is quite a bit of drama in the film but most of it is internal.,7/10
1181,Imitation of Life,"The movie looks incredible, especially considering it was made in 1934, and its sophisticated story is modern enough to be equally powerful today.",4/5
1182,Twilight,"At a slim 94 minutes, there's a lot of stuff that's packed into an awfully small package. Still, the chance to see Newman, Sarandon and Hackman working together is worth a cramp or two.",3/4
1183,Hush,It is to scary movies what Sesame Street's 'the Count' is to vampires.,37/100
1184,Passion (Godard's Passion),This film has enough intellectual stimulation in it for me not to loathe it...,C-
1185,The Mark of Zorro,Far and away the best Zorro ever!,5/5
1186,Of Mice and Men,Inventive filming of the Steinbeck novel with a classic performance by Chaney,4/5
1187,A Perfect Murder,"...the story offers so many lapses in logic, so many plot holes and so much dialogue to howl for that there's plenty to talk about afterward.",3/5
1188,Les Miserables,"A disappointing film that can be strangely cold and antiseptic, its wonderful story and its production save the day in the end. But if you don't want to see this version, you can rent one of the others or wait a few years for the next one.",3/4
1189,Madeline,"Madeline' is a quietly charming movie, for kids not too hyped on action and candy. It's assisted mightily by the presence of McDormand and Hawthorne, who play their roles precisely, not broadly, and come across as people, not caricatures.",3/4
1190,The Parent Trap,"Responsibility for making this Trap tender rests heaviest on the bird-size shoulders of auburn-haired, freckle-faced Lohan, now 11, who won the unenviable job of making us forget about Hayley Mills -- at least temporarily.",B
1191,Out of Sight,It's amazing that a film based on one of his novels has realized how to appropriately connect two characters emotionally with their audience.,4/4
1192,The Avengers,"Did anyone really think it would work? Critically savaged, already an embarrassing failure at the box office, The Avengers is a big, spinning Wiffle ball of a movie.",D+
1193,Dirty Work,"Worthless but awfully earnest slapstick from Macdonald, who ain't finding the Big Screen quite so simple.",1.5/5
1194,The Negotiator,"Just about everyone in The Negotiator is either blowing off steam or holding it in, and that's the movie's chief pleasure. The action is really a pipeline into audience fantasies-of restraint and release, of hot-blooded aggression made cool.",B+
1195,Blade,It's stylish and fast-paced. It's also a lot of fun.,3/4
1196,Mafia!,"This picture does for dumb humor what Armageddon does for action shots and The Mask of Zorro does for swordfights, flinging them out so frantically that you feel you've gotten your money's worth long before the halfway mark.",2/4
1197,Rounders,"You'll enjoy the superlative acting of Matt Damon, whose dimensions are tested and found in abundance here far more than they appear in his smaller role in Saving Private Ryan.",7/10
1198,Return to Paradise,...It all seems to be a predictable formula-driven film instead of one filled with an unpredictable raw energy.,C-
1199,Funny Games,This beautifully acted and paced German variant of Cape Fear ... is tricked out with a number of Brechtian devices to catch audiences in a voyeuristic trance.,3/5
1200,Soldier,An insipid science fiction action yarn that makes you long for the realism of Pigs in Space.,0/4
1201,Tango,The dancing is good enough to carry this film alone.,B-
1202,The Thin Red Line,An amazing triumph that proves what a master Terrence Malick is at his craft.,3.5/4
1203,Elizabeth,"Not only makes the traditionally stuffy and aloof British costume drama accessible, but entertaining and exciting as well.",3.5/4
1204,Happiness,"Happiness is not a film about happiness, but what is imagined as making one happy.",B+
1205,Cousin Bette,"It is fascinating to watch Cousin Bette as she lies to everyone, pulls the strings of her puppets, and distributes justice and revenge like an angry god.",3/4
1206,Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è bella),A deeply touching story told with imagination and humor.,3/4
1207,Mighty Joe Young,King Kong light. Insipid Joe Young. Just because this film is rated PG doesn't mean it has to be written on the level of an orangutan.,1/4
1208,At First Sight,"Since January is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies, At First Sight comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace.",3/4
1209,Supernova,Not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.,5/10
1210,Lolita,The film is remarkably...disturbing. There's no other way to put it.,3.5/5
1211,True Crime,A wickedly effective thriller.,3/4
1212,Psycho,"This gutsy cinematic experiment is more than just a curiosity. It's an intelligent homage (at times even a spoof) and still a bit of a hand-wringer, even though pop culture has spoiled all the surprises.",3/4
1213,The Siege,"With gritty cinematography and taut editing, the film maintains its energy and offers a palatable reality as the tension tightens.",8/10
1214,Gloria,"The film itself is simply lifeless, with only an occasional laugh popping up here and there so that it isn't completely unbearable to watch.",1.5/4
1215,The Impostors,"This is easily one of the funniest films of the year and in many a year. A laugh riot. Honest. Please, Mum, give me more!",3.5/4
1216,Gunshy,It's clearly a good time with a good heart. Go see it.,3/4

1220,Lost and Found,Marceau is bright and charismatic and lights up the screen.,71/100
1221,Go,Three fast-paced black comedies for the price of one with each fascinating enough to stand on its own.,3/4
1222,The Mummy,"Check your brain at the door, and enjoy the bumpy ride, cause this one will have you laughing, screaming and sighing your way into the mysterious world of ancient Egypt and its spooky-dooky myths.",8/10
1223,The Winslow Boy,You might have to wait a long time before you find a film with both a family and a lawyer portrayed in such a genuine and likable way.,A
1224,The King and I,The most stupefyingly incompetent animated feature to reach the big screen in recent memory.,0.5/4
1225,The General,"Cahill is played by Brendan Gleeson, an actor of blustery ferocity whose greasy hair, piggy jowls, and lumpish, slovenly physique would make him look harmless were it not for the angry dark pools of his eyes.",B-
1226,Payback,"Sadly, though, Payback finally puts Gibson at the mercy of a torture and sadism sequence so attenuated and so painful to watch that it sabotages the picture's own quite solid instincts for theater, innovation and wit.",2/4
1227,Bent,The material is not worthy of its setting.,2/4
1228,Buena Vista Social Club,The movie reminded me of a concert where somebody behind me is talking and moving around all the time. Let them play.,2/4
1229,Friends & Lovers,An inept farce with the mentality of a tittering 15-year-old boy peering under the bedcovers with a flashlight.,1/5
1230,The Confession,As timas atuaes so desperdiadas por um roteiro medocre com tendncia  pregao.,2/5
1231,I'll Be Home for Christmas,You aren't likely to build up much holiday cheer by forcing yourself to sit through this torturous ninety-minute debacle.,1/4
1232,Underground,"For anyone who's an aficionado of film, this is pure, unadulterated bliss.",4/4
1233,The Thirteenth Floor,"The movie works. And yet it fails to be a great one because of the dissatisfying last hour, which gives us predictable twists and atrocious conclusions.",3/4
1234,Der Unhold (The Ogre),"With his slightly cross- eyed gaze of wonderment mixed with ferocious intensity, Malkovich makes Abel both childlike and frightening.",3/4
1235,Black and White,Good cop/bad cop junk we've all already seen a million times before. The beautiful Gina Gershon spices it up a bit. Still not worth watching.,1/5
1236,Jack Frost,The novelty of the snowman effects wears thin after a while.,2.5/4
1237,Deep Blue Sea,The dramatic tension and the scary thrills are enhanced by the spatial limitations of a small complex that is being flooded.,2.5/4
1238,After Sex,Rouan succeeds in showing both the dark and light sides of passion.,3/5
1239,The Haunting,The idea that this film is supposedly based on the classic novel by Jackson is an insult to the author. The words 'insinuated by' would be more factual.,0/5
1240,Dick,"In exaggerating Nixon's mannerisms, Hedaya has created the year's funniest film caricature.",3.5/5
1241,William Shakespeare's 'A Midsummer Night's Dream',"It is the timeless appeal of those words, the impassioned performances, and a bring-down-the-house third act that make this high-spirited production live up to its title.",3/4
1242,Deja Vu,A dreamy romance that at its best has the magic of a fairy tale.,3/4
1243,An Ideal Husband,I felt like I was being one-lined to a loving death in this elegant Oscar Wilde comedy/drama costume play...,B+
1244,K-911,Slobber can be funny; sentimental dog 'n' man story,3/5
1245,Fireworks (Hana-bi),"Takeshi Kitano, who made it, must be very serene or very angry; only extreme states allow such a narrow focus.",3/4

1247,In Too Deep,"In Too Deep isn't necessarily a bad film, just an average one.",2.5/4
1248,The Best Man,"It's a tribute to the actors' appeal that they can sling this hash and keep our sympathies, but they can't squeeze much drama from pure soap.",C+
1249,Man on the Moon,One of the year's most entertaining movies.,3.5/4
1250,Anna and the King,the sort of film that would have contended for a Best Picture Oscar in the mid-80s and handily won in the early 60s,B
1251,Double Jeopardy,"Everyone who plunked down $9.50 to see it could have most likely, at that moment the money left their hands, turned on the USA network and found the exact same movie playing.",D
1252,The Hurricane,"Forceful, dynamic, and wholly natural, Washington's performance ranks among the very best of his illustrious career.",3.5/4
1253,Diamonds,"[Not] a work of art, or even entertainment, but the filmic commensurate of a crippled panhandler using his handicap to beg for sympathy and change on a streetcorner.",F

1255,Guinevere,As inert as outer space.,1.5/4

1261,The Bachelor,An innocuous waste-of-time.,D
1262,Last Night,A great movie.,4.5/5
1263,A Dog of Flanders,One is tempted on such a promising but cliched movie to reduce it to a one-phrase review. The one for this picture would be: Needs more dog.,2/4
1264,Eye of the Beholder,The movie might be worth seeing if you could find a theater that offers frequent-flier miles.,2/4
1265,The Celebration (Festen),"It's a fine line to walk, that between comedy and misery, but Vinterberg handles the balancing act magnificently.",4/4

1484,Venom,this hopeless morass that has all the exuberance of damp lint and even less imagination.,0/5
1485,Capote,"Defined by moral and erotic ambiguity, Capote is a riveting drama about the celeb's most crucial decade, during which he wrote In Cold Blood, his seminal novel. In the titular role, Hoffman gives a multi-nuanced, troubled, complex performance.",A-
1486,Nine Lives,Nine Lives does contains a few tedious acting-school-exercise moments. Yet the accumulated power of the vignettes packs a wallop.,B+
1487,Festival,You'll leave the cinema satisfied by the unexpected richness of the tales.,3/5
1488,"Good Night, And Good Luck","An urgent reminder of an era of honest crusading jurnalism in which information was separated from entertainment, in contrast to the current infotainment and soft news",B
1489,Kids in America,"Like a bad episode of 'Saved by the Bell: the Next Generation' as filtered through 'Free to Be, You and Me'",3/10
1490,Rent,"Heart is the core and foundation of Rent, and it is what powers the film past its flaws into a truly transformative experience.",A
1491,Jarhead,"Given how strongly the film insists on striking its testosterone pose, Mendes might say he's too cool for political thought.",1.5/4
1492,Godzilla: Final Wars,"If this truly is his last outing, at least he's going out with a massive bang.",4.5/5
1493,The New World,"As visionary, poetic, and sumptuously mounted as his previous films, New World may be Malick's most narrative-driven work, one with clear structure, fully fleshed characters, and extremely touching ending.",B
1494,Pride and Prejudice,"At least these filmmakers make it properly cinematic, finely focussing the story while keeping it gritty and realistic",4/5
1495,The Ringer,"If Saw 2 became blockbuster with the tagline ""Oh yes, there will be blood,"" The Ringer should use the warmer and fuzzier promise, ""Oh yes, there will be hugs.""",2/4
1496,Land of Plenty,Spends so much time on the obsession with terror that it dilapidates our ability to ultimately care until it's too late.,2.5/4
1497,Breakfast on Pluto,"An odd, at times off-putting mixture of camp inflection and earnest insight.",2.5/4
1498,Mystery of the Nile,"The courage, curiosity and perhaps partial insanity of the explorers -- not to mention the film crew -- are admirable, as their trials and tribulations yield stunning images galore.",4/5
1499,The Football Factory,"Filmmaker Love brings these characters to vivid life, but they're all so hateful, racist and idiotic that we don't like them at all!",2/5
1500,Curious George,Curiously stagnant. ... It is a 82-minute movie which cries out to be a 5-minute cartoon.,1.5/4
1501,Big Momma's House 2,... unnecessary but genial ...,C+
1502,The Promise (Master of Crimson Armor) (Wu ji),It's a knockout that works on many levels.,4.5/5
1503,Pariah,"Though Kret does a poor job of telling it, there is a story struggling to be heard amid the chaos",C+
1504,Hoodwinked,Delightful and inventively savvy. The year's last animated film is also its best.,3/4
1505,Glory Road,Yet another in a string of inspiring true stories told with as little inspiration as possible.,2/4
1506,Date Movie,Leave your brain at the ticket desk and Date Movie will likely appeal. Bring it with you and you may as well have stayed at home.,3/5
1507,Why We Fight,This is just a Michael Moore film without Michael Moore -- without the ego and the bombast and the cheap theatrics. It's 'Fahrenheit 9/11' that's had a shave and a shower.,B
1508,Casanova,"In sensibility and style, this version recalls the decadent fun of Dangerous Liaisons, vivid spirit of Shakespeare in Love, and frivolous camp of Lester's Musketeers films",B+
1509,Doogal,Amlie by way of Nintendo GameCube.,1.5/4
1510,Summer Storm (Sommersturm),"Beautifully shot, with natural acting and sensitive storytelling that honestly grapples with difficult themes.",4/5
1511,Adam & Steve,"Craig Chester's Adam is a whiney, neurotic irritant, the human equivalent of shingles.",1.5/5
1512,On a Clear Day,This cinematic fable has its feet firmly planted in the real world.,4/5
1513,Clean,"...one of those movies that's admittedly very well made, but ultimately fails to engage the audience throughout.",2.5/4
1514,The Panic in Needle Park,"It is not filled with quick cutting or gimmicky editing, but Jerry Schatzberg's direction is so confident that we cover the ground effortlessly.",3.5/4
1515,London,"A muscular ensemble piece with an accomplished cast wringing out their best in an emotionally strained screenplay.""",3.5/5
1516,Little Fish,"The tension never falters as we gaze in wonder at Tracy, seen floating literally in a swimming pool and figuratively through life, and wondering if she will plunge into the deep end once again.",2.5/4
1517,Evil (Ondskan),"Hfstrm leaves no loose end untied, and no easy sentiment untapped, but there's a didacticism to Evil that undercuts its sturdy narrative construction.",2.5/5
1518,The Devil and Daniel Johnston,A compelling and obsessive humanization of American eccentricity.,3/4
1519,See No Evil,...[a] generically drab and diluted horror flick. [Kane's] a hulking sadist with the stimulating moody disposition of a blunt meat hook.,1.5/4
1520,Marie Antoinette,"A revisionist, but ultimately frivolous look at the notorious queen (""let them eat cake""), this $40 million folly is a frothy souffle rather than nutritious cuisine, made easy on the eyes by Kirsten Dunst's charm and Milena Canonero's lush costumes.",C
1521,Goal! The Dream Begins (Goal!: The Impossible Dream),"Fortunately, the direction and performances are good enough to get us through the progressively hackneyed storyline.",2.5/5
1522,The Dark,Escurido  pior do que um filme ruim:  um filme ruim que se recusa a chegar ao fim.,1/5
1523,Sleeping Dogs Lie,"Stay mostly lacks cinematic vision, as the direction utilizes similar set-ups found in any primetime sitcom, which discourages any room for comment. With that said, however, Stay is a nice little film that marks a big step-up for Goldthwait.",3.5/5
1524,The Oh in Ohio,We wind up feeling like Priscilla after sex with her husband: It was really fun at first; we just hoped it would end differently.,C+
1525,Christmas in the Clouds,"The kind of film in which you pretty much know that everything is going to turn out all right in the end. That doesn't mean, however, that one won't enjoy watching this warm and fuzzy exercise in escapism in the process.",3/5
1526,The Hoax,"More successful as a breezy tale of Clifford Irving, the maniacal liar who faked a bio of Howard Hughes, than as a portrait of the Nixon era; effort to intertwine the personal with the collective level doesn't work",B-
1527,For Your Consideration,"For Your Consideration, though uneven, is still chockfull of the low-key charm, smart performances and understated humor that are [Christopher] Guest's hallmarks.",3/5
1528,Free Zone,"With characters more often than not functioning as mouthpieces, audiences might feel like involuntary passengers trapped in the backseat.",1.5/5
1529,Standing Still,There's enough good humor to mask the pain and sometimes that's as telling a statement as you can make about young people making the transition to young adults.,3/4
1530,Superhero Movie,About five good laughs stretched over a 70-minute running time (not counting the ludicrously padded 15-minute end credits).,1.5/4
1531,The Blue Butterfly,"Pete McCormack's script only occasionally yields to melodrama. Mostly it allows the characters to breathe freely, expressing a greater range of human emotion than just love and sympathy.",3/5
1532,Straight Into Darkness,"Reminiscient of Keith Gordon's fantastic A Midnight Clear mixed with a healthy dose of Rod Serlingism, Straight Into Darkness is a dark and stark little tale.",4/5
1533,Look Both Ways,...engaging yet thoroughly innocuous...,2.5/4
1534,The Big White,"Enjoyably quirky thriller with bizarre, off-the-wall performances from its entire cast and some striking location work.",3/5
1535,Bobby,"A Nashville wannabe without Robert Altman's subtle wit, Bobby is an ambitious attempt by writer-director Emilio Estevez to capture a turbulent era through a single historic event.",2/5
1536,Cavite,"It's fast-paced and grittily entertaining, but never in that safe and generic way that most Hollywood thrillers shoot for.",4/5
1537,Land of the Blind,"A labored pastiche of familiar dystopian motifs that beats the same, totalitarian-themed drum over and over again.",1.5/4
1538,Coastlines,"By Nunez's high standards, Coastlines is conventional and outdated, a problematic hybrid of a generic crime melodrama and a more personal tale of a flawed hero who has fallen from grace and needs to restore his inner self (Nunez's specialty).",3/5
1539,A Slight Case of Murder,It works as a parody of old gangster movies; it works as a screwball comedy of the era; and it remains as funny today as when it was made.,7/10
1540,Unconscious,Unconscious is relentlessly wacky but robustly performed...,3/5
1541,Home,"The people are mostly attractive, and the acting is credible, but the story goes absolutely nowhere",2/4
1542,The Breed,"The Breed is not going to break any new horror or killer dog subgenre standards. As it stands, it is an acceptable time killer that won't challenge or offend.",3/5
1543,Stupidity,"A movie that's clever, hilarious and -- in its own stylish way -- ironic.",3/4
1544,Voices of Iraq,"By turns heartbreaking, amusing and disturbing, the film features people from different regions, economic classes and religions, recounting stories that are sometimes bleak, sometimes encouraging, but always compelling.",4/5
1545,Trade,"However lofty the film's intent, it's hard to ignore the flaws in its making nor the protagonist's own criminality relative to a captor's religious hypocrisy.",3/5
1546,Abominable,"Abominable has an almost old fashioned monster movie mentality at times, one truly tremendous movie monster, some great death scenes, and is just ferociously fun. This Bigfoot is definitely worth sighting.",3.5/5
1547,Rest Stop,"absolutely riddled with plot holes, inconsistencies, and simple errors of logic",2.5/5
1548,Red Doors,"A pleasant enough experience. However, it probably could have used a little more of the bizarre or dysfunctional to spice things up.",3/5
1549,Pizza,"There's a sharp and snappy tone to this irreverent comedy that keeps us laughing even though it's all a bit silly, really.",2.5/5
1550,The Woods,The Woods is solid and satisfying. Chillingly punctuated by vivid nightmare sequences and harrowing confrontations.,3.5/5
1551,The Magus,Caine e Quinn estabelecem uma forte qumica em um filme complexo que no se preocupa em ajudar o espectador a compreender seus intrincados jogos psicolgicos. Peca apenas pela trilha sonora inadequada e por uma atuao sem vida de Bergen.,4/5
1552,Driving Lessons,"Full of strong themes and witty interaction between its excellent cast, but it comes undone.",3/5
1553,Ballets Russes,"This very conventional PBS style videodoc should not viewed before operating heavy machinery. However, there's plenty to fascinate devotees of the dance.",2.5/5
1554,Angel Rodriguez,...there's a palpable feeling of authenticity at work here...,2.5/4
1555,Karla,"You can call it guilty of exploitation, tastelessness or insensitivity if you like, but its greatest failing is a certain deadly pointlessness.",1.5/4
1556,Death & Texas,A Hot-Button comedy that focuses on 'enlightenment via entertainment'.,4/5
1557,Cocaine Angel,"If this film was intended as a joke, consider me fooled.",1/4
1558,The Invisible,The Invisible is listless in conception and execution.,1.5/4
1559,The Bridge,"Certainly there's no denying the effectiveness of some of the material here, but The Bridge never earns its parallel to Brueghel's ""Landscape with the Fall of Icarus.""",2/4
1560,Conversations With God,"Someone advises at one point that dreams don't have deadlines, and yet the famous cover jacket of Waslch's books couldn't flash on the screen fast enough.",1.5/4
1561,Perfect Stranger,What begins as an elegant techno thriller quickly devolves into a trashy preposterously-plotted flick--it's much more fun to observe the stunningly beautiful Halle Berry change costumes than identities.,C-
1562,Vitus,One soaring performance not nearly enough,2.5/5
1563,"Definitely, Maybe",Adam Brooks's traditional rom-com isn't going to win any awards but it's easy on the brain as well as on the eyes.,2.5/4
1564,Wanted,"This is a film that I didn't expect to like, and very slowly, it started to grow on me. By the action packed finale, I was cheering out loud!",3/4
1565,Silk,"What's happened to Girard, who made the original 32 Shorts about Glenn Gould, then the mediocre Red Violin, and now a dull, studied art film, a period tale of doomed romance with no chemistry entre Michael Pitt and Keira Knightley or Pitt and other woman",C-
1566,License to Wed,"As with 50% of all marriages in this country, this film breaks down irretrievably, leaving all concerned feeling hurt, angry, and not a little betrayed.",2/5
1567,Fred Claus,Not a flake on the ground and we already have our first lump of coal.,1/6
1568,Antikörper (Antibodies),Antibodies is refreshing in that it admits that everyone -- from apple-cheeked youths to ruthless killers -- is on a sliding scale of good-to-evil.,8/10
1569,Funny Games,The purpose is to provoke and disturb the audience. It does this so well that you may not be able to watch it.,A-
1570,The Jane Austen Book Club,"As involving and heartwarming as The Jane Austen Book Club is, it's also far too much of a gimmick for its own good.",3.5/5
1571,Fail Safe,It's a fabulous original film and a worthwhile redo -- but it comes about 20 years too late.,3.5/5
1572,Lars and the Real Girl,...the viewer can't help but feel sorry for Lars...,2/4
1573,Ghosts of Abu Ghraib,"Part broad exploration of human nature, part specific examination of Abu Ghraib, the film posits the question: how does one fight an enemy who recognizes no set laws of engagement?",4/5
1574,Longford,"Intelligent, thoughtful cinema for mature viewers who don't need special effects and quick cuts to feel engaged with a movie.",82/100
1575,A Simple Curve,"Possesses wisdom that is rare for film these days, let alone a debut.",3.5/4
1576,Tortilla Heaven,"Tortilla Heaven is a consistently engaging motion picture, made with obvious love for the isolated location and for the spirit of a supportive community.",B+
1577,Madeinusa,The assured debut of 29-year-old writer-director Claudia Llosa operates on several different levels.,3/4
1578,10 MPH,"Ultimately, I was more intrigued by the journey these guys took, but was severely disappointed by how little actually happened on the way.",2.5/5
1579,Hurricane on the Bayou,"Seen on an Imax screen, the now-familiar imagery of the devastation in New Orleans and other areas takes on a new resonance as the sheer size of the affected areas is felt more fully.",3/5
1580,In Debt We Trust,"Unfortunately, there isn't much insight into this possible bleak future, nor is there anything new in this 89-minute film, which plays more like an episode of 20/20 or Dateline NBC.",1/4
1581,The Contract,...sporadically intriguing yet thoroughly mediocre...,2/4
1582,Descent,"One can't say that the film ""devolves"" into revenge fantasy in its final act, because that seems to be the whole intention of the filmmakers. But still, what the point is of such an unpleasant and prolonged exercise in hate -- as Descent's climax is -- is",1.5/5
1583,Kannathil Muthamittal (A Peck on the Cheek),"This lavish Indian comedy-drama is unsure of what it wants to be, but still manages to be charming and consistently entertaining.",3/5
1584,"Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys!","Newman e Woodward parecem estar se divertindo a valer, mas o ingnuo roteiro no permitiu que o filme envelhecesse bem",2/5
1585,Hollywood Dreams,This take on the classic story of an ingenue trying to make her way in the City of Angels is no pleasure -- not when the ingenue is Margie Chizek (Tanna Frederick).,1.5/5
1586,The Final Season,"While obviously important to those who made the film, [it] probably won't hold that much interest to anyone not directly involved with the story.",5/10
1587,The Last Time,"While his cast is first-rate, director-writer Michael Caleo doesn't know quite what his movie is about.",2.5/4
1588,Take,"Writer/director Charles Oliver, in his first feature-length film, has captured the essence of how forgiveness frees the soul.",3.5/4
1589,You Kill Me,"Even when he's worked with escalated budgets, John Dahl has retained his playful noir side.",3/4
1590,Amu,[Director] Bose embeds her history lesson in a drama with authentic emotional mother-daughter conflict.,3/4
1591,Splinter,"With its recycled themes and muddled storyline generating a cascade of unanswered questions, the film is more about style than substance.",2.5/5
1592,11/8/16,A fair and balanced poll taken on election day sporting a record number of directors (18).,B
1593,As You Like It,"Energetic and entertaining, but it's like a long episode of an over-talky, out-of-control soap opera.",3/5
1594,The Hunting Party,"He's telling the story of a post-war Bosnia so ignored by the international community, war criminals are free to list their names in the phone book. You can't make stuff like that up. But Shepard makes us think he did.",2.5/5
1595,Michael Moore Hates America,"Wilson makes it clear that he doesn't share Moore's political beliefs, but the film isn't about ideology as much as accountability. The theme is: How does he get away with it?",3/4
1596,Dirty Laundry,"Jamal's comedy of family dysfunction is essentially a sitcom episode writ large; it's not subtle, but it's good-natured and hits its marks with ruthless efficiency.",2/4
1597,Evil Aliens,"It's splattery and loud and frantic and laden with wall-to-wall gore of the nastiest kind. And yes, I mean that in the nicest way possible.",4.5/5
1598,The Burning,It's a legitimately ugly movie; it gets under your skin.,4/5
1599,Alvin and the Chipmunks,"If you love The Chipmunks, this is a great new chapter to add to your memories.",4/5
1600,The Unknown Soldier,Another apt title for Michael Verhoeven's new film could be It's All True.,3/5
1601,Dear Pillow,"a real shocker that indie film fans will thoroughly enjoy. You will, however, need a shower afterwards.",4/5
1602,Coffee Date,"Amid a recent flurry of low-budget independent productions, Coffee Date is a standout with its strongly developed central characters, complex themes and polished look.",3.5/5
1603,The Express,"In the past few years, we have seen lots of football films, and this is by far the best. I might even be so bold to say that this is the greatest football movie of all time.",3.5/4
1604,The Rape of Europa,"Fortunately, historical facts far outweigh psychological speculation in The Rape of Europa.",3.5/5
1605,Broken,"A stagy piece that allows the audience to wonder how much is going on in the central character's drug-induced hallucinations and how much is real--No matter, though, since nothing is particularly dramatic or original.",C
1606,Itty Bitty Titty Committee,"While the film is engaging, it feels unwilling to really push its themes into provocative territory.",3/5
1607,Strange Culture,"A brilliant statement on artistic freedom and the dangers it faces. This film should be seen, should be discussed and is an important document on our times.",4/5
1608,Blindness,"Meirelles' adaptation of the popular novel is flawed--central acts are weak and lack power--but in its good moments, it's a thought provoking, visually impressive meditation on the fragility of humanity, an apt reflection of the post 9/11 zeitgeist",B-
1609,Mad Money,"Somewhat surprising that it's not nearly as awful as it could have been, but tragic to watch Diane Keaton's career continue its path into embarrassing roles that undermine her acting talent.",6/10
1610,The Haunting in Connecticut,"The Haunting in Connecticut isn't a standout in its genre, but it offers enough creepy moments and scares to entertain the occasional horror fan.",3/5
1611,Billy the Kid,"In the end, it's the absent father figure that hobbles the story of a decent kid unable to edit himself for better or for worse.",C+
1612,Tenderness,"Polson maintains an unsettling tension throughout the narrative, building his slow-burn thriller to a climax that deliberately runs counter to the in-your-face genre principles of which he proved such a master with his first two thriller outings.",3/5
1613,Angels & Demons,The film is a breezy if improbable pyscho-religious action-thriller that's slightly better than Da Vinci Code but still not good enough.,C
1614,The Lovely Bones,"So infuriatingly coy, and so desperate to preserve the modesty of its soulful victim that it amounts to an ongoing clean-up operation.",2/5
1615,Shelter,"What could have been a standard-issue coming-out, coming-of-age movie develops a remarkable intimacy.",3.5/4
1616,The Great Buck Howard,"A wonderfully refreshing and original film; this may be John Malkovich's best role and performance, maybe of his career.",9/10
1617,The Bank Job,Has enough originality to distinguish it from other caper movies.,B
1618,Zack and Miri Make a Porno,"One of Kevin Smith's funniest, dirtiest, most gleefully offensive movies to date.",4/5
1619,Blood Creek,"Creek nevertheless fails to live up to the director's proven talents as a convincing screen stylist. It's ugly, raw, and marginally tasteless, so perhaps the irksome inability to clearly see what's going on is an unintentional gift.",C-
1620,Over Her Dead Body,"For a pure shot of cinematic depression, nothing quite tops opening credits that end with ""...and Jason Biggs.""",1/4
1621,Imagine That,"Murphy's goofy, bug-eyed hysterics seem played out and overly familiar.",3/5
1622,Ghost Town,"A charming date film for adults: Koepp makes a quantum leap forward as helmer of a whimsically supernatural romantic fable that borrows elements from Blithe Spirit, Topper, Heaven Can Wait, and Ghost yet impresses as a work with its own quirky sensibility",B+
1623,College,"Zippy, lightweight, raucously silly, and embracing of its well-earned R rating, College doesn't pretend to be deep or anything more than it is: a you-are-there portrayal of three high schoolers let loose on a hard-partying university campus.",2.5/4
1624,Changeling,"Eastwood's femme-driven thriller explores police corruption and social injustice in an old-fashioned, studio-era-like film that lacks much nuance or complexity but is nonetheless enjoyable.",B
1625,L.A. Twister,"Silly, good-natured and full of unlikely moves.",2.5/5
1626,Life is a Bed of Roses,What happens when a skeptic tackles tranquility? He makes it look dangerous.,60/100
1627,What Love Is,"A shrill cacophony of puerile clichs about men and women and sex, delivered in adrenaline-driven harangues and arrogant lectures. When the stage clears, all that's left is the unpleasant odor of all that hot air.",F
1628,No Smoking,"The film swirls about frantically in the effort to entertain, has a terrible Bob Fosse-like dance sequence and generally overstays its welcome.",2/5
1629,Mister Lonely,"After eight dark and reclusive years (including drug rehab), enfant terrible Korine is back with a disappointingly slight and whimsical fable about the romance between a Michael Jackson and a Marilyn Monroe impersonators, peppered with skydiving nuns!",C-
1630,Hell Ride,"There's always something to be said for bare boobs and pointless violence, but the flick wears out its welcome long before it reaches the finish line.",2/5
1631,Partition,"Where the film stumbles is the script, overcrowded with bits of business and scenes that lean heavily on the symbolic.",2/4
1632,Smart People,Has enough funny moments and original ideas that it's genuinely enjoyable based on the strength of its script and cast alone.,8/10
1633,The Cottage,Williams' story twists and turns...veering from Coen caper to Hooper horror -- but the one unifying constant is the film's wicked streak of humour.,3.5/5
1634,State of Play,"Laced with telegraphed character development, ghost-in-the-machine plot points, and preachy commentary, ""State of Play"" is a pedantic thriller caught in its own obvious clockwork.",C
1635,All Hat,There is no getting around that the film is as dry as an unpaved country road.,2/4
1636,Trumbo,This may be the last film to feature Trumbo's writing and it has some of his most powerful prose. It is may be the best film that has ever been made about the Hollywood blacklist and the Hollywood Ten.,8/10
1637,Deal,Deal recycles every nuance of every underdog sports movie -- from Rocky to Rudy to Invincible -- but not well. Burt Reynolds plays a mysterious stranger like he needs a three-year nap.,1/5
1638,Chapter 27,"Worth seeing for Leto's performance ... but its slow, meandering pace tends to be its undoing.",6/10
1639,Step Brothers,McKay keeps his comedy from straying too far into Adam Sandler turf by limiting the overt sentimentality and not letting the melodrama overwhelm the gloriously crass dialogue and intentionally childish conduct of Ferrell and Reilly who work well together,B-
1640,Botched,"Botched is bungled - irredeemably, at times even enjoyably, so.",1/5
1641,Noise,"A great ride with an entertaining story. This was a decent crime thriller and until the form is revived inearnest, Noise will more than hold down the fort.",3/5
1642,Burning the Future: Coal in America,"The title is enough to tell you that Novack on the side of a West Virginia community being decimated by mountaintop mining, but it's also the right side.",2.5/4
1643,Miss Conception,It doesn't take long to recognize this cloyingly cute comedy for what it really is: misconceived.,2/5
1644,Elegy,"Based on Philip Roth's novella ""The Dying Animal,"" ""Elegy"" an impassioned cinematic adaptation from director Isabel Coixet (""The Secret Life of Worlds"")...",A
1645,The Take,"If you usually dig John Leguizamo's work, then you'll definitely want to see this one.",3.5/5
1646,All in This Tea,"Brisk and agreeable, a handcrafted ode to the brew that is the beverage of choice where the Chinese, among many others, are concerned.",3.5/5
1647,Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (Ice Age 3),"Lazy, transparent, disposable and at its worst, boring.",1.5/5
1648,High School Musical 3: Senior Year,"More significant as a socio-cultural and demographic than artistic phenomenon, HSM3 is conventional to a fault, but is unadulterated fun, a movie that at once caters to and exploits its demographic status.",B-
1649,Heart of the Beholder,A disturbing story that is worth telling.,B
1650,Fanaa,"To resort to strictly ethnocentric references, Fanaa is equal parts MGM extravaganza, Shakespeare lite and James Bond. In their heart of hearts, isn't that what movie audiences really want?",3/5
1651,Encounters at the End of the World,There's little doubt that one's appreciation for the movie is directly related to one's fascination with Antarctica's barren landscape...,3/4
1652,Phoebe in Wonderland,"Phoebe may not be schizophrenic, but any movie that simultaneously wants to trouble and reassure, to keep it real and then traffic in wish fulfillment, certainly is.",2.5/5
1653,Love and Other Disasters,...an unabashedly cliched and lighthearted romantic comedy that seems to thrive on the conventions of the genre...,2.5/4
1654,Bunt. Delo Litvinenko (Poisoned by Polonium: The Litvinenko File) (Rebellion: The Litvinenko Case),"A muckraking documentary of vast shuddery intrigue, makes a disquieting case that Russia hasn't just slipped back to its old oligarchic ways -- but that, in fact, it's a more repressive, corroded place than it was in the age of the Soviet Union.",B+
1655,Salaam Namaste,Salaam Namaste must set some sort of record for genre pileup.,1/5
1656,The Wolfman,"The poor pacing, blatantly obvious narrative signposting and over-reliance on false scares generated by sudden sounds and movements, removes any chance of The Wolfman actually being frightening.",1/5
1657,Happy-Go-Lucky,"In the factory-farmed blandness of the movies, Happy-Go-Lucky has a strong, real taste.",4/5
1658,Viva,Its triumph is that of style -- gloriously and revoltingly tacky style -- over substance.,2.5/4
1659,My Winnipeg,"Part documentary, part autobiography, part psychotherapy, Maddin's smooth narration and pithy asides take us in his inimitable style on a journey through what he dubs ""the coldest city in North America"".",A
1660,Space Chimps,Saturday morning-grade fare that young children may enjoy but anybody older than eight will find bland and utterly forgettable.,C
1661,Hounddog,The much-hyped rape scene isn't even remotely the worst offense of this tedious and overrated film.,3/10
1662,Never Forever,"Beautifully shot and acted, with a heartbreaking story, Never Forever is worth the effort.",4/5
1663,The Princess and the Frog,"You'll walk away in a good mood, happy to see Disney back on track. But ... there's not much to remember in the morning.",3.5/5
1664,Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,Overstuffed with enough sight gags to delight children while throwing in healthy dollops of wordplay and absurdist humor to keep their adult chaperones entertained as well.,4/5
1665,Lou Reed's Berlin,"An intimate venue coupled with incredibly energetic and heart-felt performances from Reed, the Brooklyn Youth Chorus and a string and brass section to die for make for a moving experience.",4/5
1666,Patti Smith: Dream of Life,The soul of one of rock's true poets is examined in an appropriately abstract way in Steven Sebring's black and white documentary that could have benefited from more of Patti Smith's songs and another pass in the editing room.,B
1667,Lakeview Terrace,Strong performances from its talented ensemble cast don't compensate for its narrative flaws.,C-
1668,Quarantine,"An entire movie set in a sealed off, old school apartment building with terror around every corner should convey a severe sense of claustrophobia in every shot. Quarantine may as well have been filmed in a warehouse.",1.5/5
1669,Reprise,"This likeable, smart Danish drama about two aspiring writers has some of the arch, extra-dry-martini quality of a Whit Stillman film, including jumping locations and a dry, ironic voice-over.",3/4
1670,Before the Rains,Mechanical through and through.,2/4
1671,My Name Is Bruce,One-note insider navel-gazing with no aspirations except to excite its adoring base.,1.5/4
1672,Mirrors,"Aja attempts to take a slow-burning ghost story and turn it into one of his over-the-top gorefests and loses the essence of the story in his endeavors... before wasting any money on this at theaters, you should probably reflect on it a bit...",2/5
1673,Trapped Ashes,A horrible mess of horror movie cliches...,D
1674,"OSS 117: Le Caire Nid d'Espions (OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies)",OSS has style in spades.,3/5
1675,Hofshat Kaits (My Father My Lord),"Its gripping sense of empathy, parlayed through a Sokurovian fixation on faces and the love and fear transmitted between beaming sets of eyes, practically burns a hole through the screen.",3/4
1676,Ballast,"With spare and minimalist yet powerful strokes, Ballast, the feature debut of the gifted Lance Hammer, captures a slice of African American life in the Mississippi Delta in a way that recalls the early lyrical work of Charles Burnett (Killer of Sheep).",A-
1677,Paris,"As Klapisch wanders through vignettes of dreams and disappointments, he offers a captivating and never prescriptive paeon to humanity's will to survive.",4/5
1678,Never Say Macbeth,Foul is fair and this movie's pretty darn good.,4/5
1679,Fantastic Mr. Fox,"After two flops, Anderson is back on terra ferma with a well-acted (especially Clooney), sporadically entertaining rendition of Dahl's classic, a retro-cool quirky, if also indulgent, film on which he imposes his unmistakable worldview, format and tone.",B+
1680,The Art Of Travel,It's too bad that there isn't a documentary about the making of The Art of Travel since that would undoubtedly make for an interesting movie.,2/4
1681,Ballet Shoes,"It's a caloric helping of melodrama, but it's rendered effective by the exceptional performances and observant direction by the vastly talented Sandra Goldbacher.",B+
1682,The Perfect Game,"Here's a sweetly mannered sports movie with heart, that's ideal for introducing baseball traditions and vocabulary to kids.",B-
1683,Shutter Island,The work of a master at his height. This is Scorsese flexing his muscles and cracking his knuckles and making a movie that's intense and thrilling and engrossing and beautiful and dense.,8.5/10
1684,Disfigured,"A delightful and honest story, full of poignant and humorous moments, it speaks to the fat and the skinny person in all of us.",3/4
1685,Bustin' Down the Door,Includes of some of the most extraordinary surf footage seen since Bruce Brown's early Endless Summer films.,3/5
1686,Ninja Assassin,An East meets West splatterfest unfolding like a lethal cross of Crouching Tiger and Sam Peckinpah.,4/4
1687,Recount,"Recount, an efficient and relentless enactment of the strategists on both sides of the Florida controversy, shows an accident that was waiting to happen.",3/4
1688,I Love You Beth Cooper,"Chris Columbus' high school comedy-adventure is a bland, overly familiar tale in which all the characters are stereotypes.",C
1689,Far North,"The freaky finale kind of undermines any sympathy we might have built up, but it adds a level of classical storytelling that makes the film feel utterly timeless.",3.5/5
1690,11-11-11,"Bousman overcooks a simple premise, spending too much time on laborious exposition and not enough on dramatic elements, allowing wooden performances and a low-budget chill to paralyze the effort.",D+
1691,11 Minutes (11 Minut),"For a movie that is all about accumulation, it adds up to very little, and for a story all about connectedness, ""11 minutes,"" intermittently enjoyable though it may be, never connects.",C
1692,The 11th Hour,"Among recent documentaries questioning the status quo, The 11th Hour takes the most far-reaching point of view and connects issues into larger patterns, culminating in a truly global call for change.",4/5
1693,The Informant!,Soderbergh has delivered a mildly entertaining confection here but it lacks the bite and depth you might have expected from such explosive subject matter.,3/5
1694,RoboCop,"Throughout, one character refers to the new RoboCop as 'Tin Man' and to the film's credit, it desperately wants to have a heart. Oh, if it only had a brain.",2/5
1695,The Wrecking Crew,"Long on nostalgia, the film does shed further light on the genius of Brian Wilson and the unfair uproar over the Monkees' need for musical backup. Turns out even the Beach Boys required the Wrecking Crew to rock.",2.5/4
1696,Closing the Ring,"Closing the Ring is well-acted throughout and it has a romantic appeal that is not to be sneered at, even if some may find it bland.",3/5
1697,Dorian Gray,"As I left the cinema, I heard someone say they had aged twenty five years while watching the film. Sadly, I concur.",5/10
1698,Nobel Son,"Techs are better than Nobel Son deserves. Writer-director-producer-editor Miller does not have the chops, not yet, to pull off such a ponderous multi-hyphenate.",D+
1699,17 Again,"Though sweet and occasionally charming, the comedy is innocuous, formulaic and predictable, borrowing elements from Big, Peggy Sue, Back to the Future.",C
1700,The Good Life,"The film spends what seems like interminable hours driving home the brutal truth that the world is better off without Jason Prayer, and, despite the anemic flip-flop of the last twenty seconds, it's hard to disagree.",2/5
1701,The Tooth Fairy,"It's one of those reliable old cast-against-type comic turns that sends the character on a funny, predictable journey of sobering revelation.",3/5
1702,The Greatest,"It's quite a good film and is extremely well acted, but its emotional assaults were so powerful that I found myself almost unable to endure them.",3/4
1703,Labor Pains,"The film is just a puddle of mediocrity from filmmakers who couldn't be bothered with putting some effort into their work, and a lead actress who's only trolling for a quick paycheck.",D
1704,Dark Streets,"Dark Streets may only be a quasi-noir and quasi-musical, but that doesn't stop it from being a wholesale slog.",1/4
1705,The Book of Revelation,"Clearly, with its unabashedly honest nudity, steamy scenes of bondage, masturbation, sodomy and even some old-fashioned fucking, this is no flick for kids.",4.5/5
1706,Open Window,I just couldn't buy into the way the film veered into a family drama when it started out so confidently.,2.5/5
1707,Green Zone,"This is a kind of experiment, and it's only partly successful. But, set against the most expansive, otherworldly backdrop this side of James Cameron's Pandora, it's an appropriately spooky experience.",B-

1709,Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father,"Prepare to be equally angry and emotionally drained as you watch real, so-called justice in action. This film will be one of the best you're likely to see this year.",4/4
1710,Under the Sea 3D,"The IMAX format is ideal for the subject matter and, like its predecessors, this documentary proves to be a hybrid of entertainment and education, revealing rarely-seen natural splendors while sounding alarm bells about the environment.",2.5/5
1711,Dance of the Dead,"It's fast and funny, sick and sweet, geeky and gory. Basically, a whole lot of fun.",4.5/5
1712,Fetching Cody,Ray's script shambles off in all directions and succeeds only in reinforcing our disbelief.,1.5/4
1713,Me and Orson Welles,"Though Me & Orson Welles is nice and smart and unobjectionable, it's the least exciting, least vibrant movie Linklater has ever made.",C+
1714,Center Stage: Turn It Up,"Attractive cast, predictable girl-lives-dream story and lots of great dancing.",3/5
1715,The Children,"This is a rare film that strikes a perfect chord between subtle and visceral scares, between the primal and the nightmarish, between surreal and survival horror...Tom Shankland delivers the most white-knuckled experience yet with The Children.",4.5/5
1716,War Child,"War Child, a documentary about the hip-hop artist Emmanuel Jal, is a bit ragged and repetitive, but certainly this young man's life is amazing proof that one person really can make a difference.",3/5
1717,Garbage Warrior,"Garbage Warrior is, in the end, a fitting tribute to a free spirit and a valuable citizen.",2.5/4
1718,The Last House on the Left,"As an exploitation B-horror movie, this latest addition to the genre is heads and shoulders above anything Rob Zombie has ever done.",B-
1719,The Crazies,"Impatient as they may be, the filmmakers never lose sight of what's important, namely keeping Dutton's rag-tag group of survivors sympathetic and perpetually in peril.",3.5/4

1721,The Three Stooges,Neither honors the Stooges' legacy nor provides any justification for bringing them into the present day.,1.5/5
1722,The Lodger,"While noirish films may appear beyond their welcome, 'The Lodger' compels attention by intricate plotting.",B
1723,Paper Man,"Reaches out for a hug and demands a few tears, but the execution of the film is irritating, making this sensitive picture dishearteningly hopeless and, at least during a few key moments of the feature, seemingly endless.",D+
1724,Creation,Darwin came up with some interesting theories about life but didn't have an interesting enough life to have made a movie about it.,6/10
1725,Our Man in Havana,A droll black comedy.,B-
1726,Crips and Bloods: Made in America,Peralta's presentation is so concise and efficient that it often overshadows the fact that some of his doc's contentions aren't particularly novel.,3/4
1727,Tennessee,"The dramatic payoffs are either nonexistent or overly manipulated, and for a journey that starts with so much deep-set pain and regret to end with a sentimental twist feels, to use a phrase anathema in Carey's world, off-key.",2/5
1728,Free Style,"For High School Musical fans unwaveringly devoted to Corbin Bleu, Free Style provides ample opportunity to swoon over the former East High basketballer's big floppy hair and Disney Channel-grade emoting.",1/4
1729,Helen,I wish the movie itself had mood swings as wild as Mathilda's. Judd's depression is relentless.,2/5
1730,Four Flies on Grey Velvet (4 mosche di velluto grigio),"As far as Argento films go, none come weirder than the little-seen Four Flies on Grey Velvet.",3/4
1731,Weapons,What this childish wallow was doing in the Dramatic Competition at Sundance only Robert Redford's minions know.,0/4
1732,Islander,... a moving old-fashioned drama and a throwback to how indies first blossomed a generation or so ago.,B
1733,The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3,"Travolta is terrific in this sharper, wittier, thoroughly contemporary revisit to the New York subway train derailed by a intelligent but psychotic criminal.",B
1734,Obsessed,"If you know the title, you know everything you're going to learn about the movie.",2/4
1735,Katyn,"As definitive withdrawal from Iraq inches ever nearer into our finger-crossed view, elliptical confrontation of military trauma is once again becoming fashionable in American cinema houses.",3/4
1736,Sugarhouse,"In the bristling and brutal crime thriller Sugarhouse, Andy Serkis delivers a performance that makes his turn as King Kong look like Johnny Vegas's knitted monkey sidekick.",4/5
1737,Weather Girl,The film breaks down into a simplistic dichotomy.,1/4
1738,Unmade Beds,A minimalist drama about two newcomers to London searching for love in all the wrong places.,3/5
1739,Adam,"This credible and moving portrayal of a man with Asperger's Syndrome, whose passion for science and his love for a woman help him in his struggle to achieve a meaningful relationship, should find an appreciative audience.",3.5/5
1740,Tyson,Toback's rare close-up view of some of the inherent contradictions in American hero worship makes Tyson a worthwhile coda to the mirage of athletic greatness Tyson's career represents.,3/5
1741,The Boys Are Back,A head-turning performance by Clive Owen and a similar breakthrough from Emma Booth ... an incredibly powerful and moving film.,8.5/10
1742,Splice,"Despite an A-list star and a high-tech plot, the film itself feels like a hybrid of silly science tingler and moral philosophy with a straight-to-video sheen-which is likely where their larger profit margins lie.",2/5
1743,Crossing Arizona,"Everyone knows that illegal immigration is a problem, but there's really no answer to be found. Crossing Arizona does a nice job covering all sides of the issue.",3.5/5
1744,It's Complicated,It's adulterated.,C
1745,The Cove,"I've seen hundreds of horror movies in my time, and I've never seen anything quite as disturbing as the final sequences of The Cove.",4.5/5
1746,Vinyan,...it's ultimately impossible to deny the effectiveness of the astonishingly grim atmosphere.,2.5/4
1747,12:08 East of Bucharest (A fost sau n-a fost?),"A deadpan comedy that evolves into a wry, politicized examination of truth.",3.5/4
1748,Black Sun,It is incomprehensible that such an amazing story could be the foundation of such a boring and inept film.,1/5
1749,Mary and Max,"Both sad and funny, it's a moving film that will more than likely result in audiences having to fight back tears throughout the final credits.",4/5
1750,New York,"A captivating, gripping and thoroughly provocative thriller.",8.75/10
1751,Puss in Boots,The results are so funny and irresistible audiences are bound to be swept away into this kitty's universe.,4/5
1752,Mystery Team,"The twentysomething talents behind Mystery Team are still in the comedy minors, but this nerdy, nutty, perfectly pitched first swing suggests there are major things to come.",3/5
1753,Reunion,A soap opera disguised as a serious chamber drama in the tradition of Paddy Chayefsky.,2.5/4
1754,The Last Word,Is this where The Last Word really wants to go? Into flimsy clich?,2.5/5

1756,The Twilight Saga: Eclipse,The latest installment of the Twilight franchise's teeny-bopper-vampire-werewolf-melodrama comes the closest so far to presenting an entertaining cinematic experience but still not close enough for uninitiated audiences.,C
1757,Antichrist,The trouble is that Antichrist feels progressively symptomatic of a director losing heart.,2/4
1758,Splinterheads,"Despite positioning itself as a Napoleon Dynamite-style comedy about a spazzy social retard, Splinterheads seems to have misplaced most of its jokes.",0.5/4
1759,Baby on Board,"This lightweight concoction about a pregnancy that throws a power couple into marital crisis is a smart, funny and raunchy surprise.",3/5
1760,Extract,"You get the sense that if only Mike Judge made more pictures, he'd hit his stride alongside the likes of Apatow pretty quick.",B-
1761,The Debt,...a solid little thriller...,2.5/4
1762,Everybody's Fine,"Under the helm and pen of Kirk Jones what was a sensitive and touching dramedy in Tornatore's 1990 film has become conventional, predictable and schmaltzy, forcing the actors, especially the estimable De Niro, to emote in a big way.",C
1763,Last Night,"Keira Knightley gives one of her most nuanced performances, showing extraordinary range without ever coming across as showy... This is a well crafted, enjoyable ensemble piece with a captivating conclusion.",B+
1764,Howl,"Milk meets Pink Floyd the Wall. Says everything it has to say in the first 20 minutes, then keeps repeating itself.",2/4
1765,Life During Wartime,There is something to giggle at in nearly every frame of the movie.,B-
1766,The Friends of Eddie Coyle,A bleak look at how the Boston underworld operates.,B+
1767,The Skeptic,"The supernatural is the hobgoblin of the titular doubting Thomas in The Skeptic, though judging by writer-director Tennyson Bardwell's hapless mood shifts in this tepid horror-comedy, it seems consistency of tone deserves even less credibility.",2/4
1768,Remember Me,"If it is to be remembered, it'll be for all the wrong reasons.",2/5
1769,Uncle Nino,"Though convinced it's helping people to rediscover their roots, the film succeeds only in planting corn.",1.5/4

1771,"C'est Pas Moi, Je le Jure! (It's Not Me, I Swear!)","Modest, but resonant, It's Not Me, I Swear!, is a Quebec coming-of-age story that juggles elements of dark humour, pathos and childhood whimsy.",3/4
1772,Home,"A very clever and creative film that probes on family solidarity, change, the toxic residues of a car culture, and the physical, psychological and spiritual effects of noise pollution.",4/5
1773,Triangle,"If you're a fan of Christopher Smith's previous work and want to see his cinematic maturation, it's definitely worth seeing Triangle as it certainly isn't a complete loss.",2.5/5
1774,BLAST!,Intellectually fascinating but fails to engage on a deeper level. Best suited for TV's educational channels and media libraries.,5/10
1775,Get Him to the Greek,B-list Apatow with moments of laugh-out-loud hilarity.,B-
1776,Home,"Though there is little here for an informed person to take issue with, the film's well-intentioned preachiness is unlikely to win over those who favor Genesis and denial over climate science.",2/5
1777,The End of the Line,"The End of the Line understates its case. If what it says is true, it does not seem angry enough. And does it really provide enough facts to underline its argument?",3/5
1778,The Eclipse,"The Eclipse shoots willy-nilly for too many registers of fear, and it never emanates a confident sense of what we are learning about these men and women by watching them panic, shudder, and second-guess themselves.",C-
1779,The Blind Side,"Bullock may have found her Erin Brockovich in Tuohy, commanding the screen with grit and determination in an Oscar-worthy role if ever there was one.",4/5
1780,Stone of Destiny,"Smith, who also wrote the screenplay, is all brisk efficiency over the course of the movie's fat-free 96 minutes.",2.5/4
1781,Furry Vengeance,"A stupid, mean-spirited little movie that ranks down there with the worst in recent memory. Distant memory, too.",1/5
1782,Warrior,"Warrior is emotionally intense and decently acted, but it's too familiar as family melodrama and too manipulative as populist and inspirational sports picture.",C
1783,Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,"Dumb, boring and predictable, rarely ever exceeding its TV movie esthetic and leading to the most ridiculous last-minute twist.",3.5/10
1784,A Prophet (Un prophete),"A Prophet is an astonishingly detailed crime drama that could end up being this year's Gomorra, but although it's arguably more accessible.",4/5
1785,Homecoming,"Pitched halfway between legitimately self-aware slasher camp and--shudder--a sincere relationship thriller, Homecoming hardly seems worth the hour-and-half effort at first.",2.5/4
1786,American Son,"Blessed with a powerful, honest screenplay.",B
1787,The Narrows,Awfully familiar yet superbly acted...,2.5/4
1788,Big Fan,"Roll over Quentin Tarantino and tell Robert Rodriguez the news. With Big Fan, Robert Seigel proves that the existential poetics of popular culture have a new laureate.",3.5/5
1789,Salt,Philip Noyce keeps the action red hot for a laughably implausible espionage story about Angelina Jolie's Russian double-spy character Evelyn Salt.,B-
1790,Did You Hear About the Morgans?,"This fish out of water rom-com is predictable and sappy but the contrast between New York and Wyoming, filmed with fine production values, makes for some interest.",C+
1791,World's Greatest Dad,"A truly strange comedy that actually has a message hidden beneath its colorfully tacky exterior. Admirably twisted, too.",4/5
1792,No Impact Man: The Documentary,"As much a sociological study, of the way a modern urban couple relate and negotiate for individual priorities, as a practical experiment of living a sustainable lifestyle, ""No Impact Man"" is a thought provoking documentary that's as entertaining as it is",B
1793,Ghosted,"Feels like an overwritten fringe festival play, performed outdoors, with a single camera recording it for posterity.",2/5
1794,Death in Love,"A stagy, melodramatic, and downright effective story about the way a mother's pain is passed on to her brood.",B+
1795,X Games 3D: The Movie,"As a movie, X-Games 3D: The Movie isn't a movie at all. It's a 90-minute commercial for the games, lacking much in the line of drama, compelling characters or story line.",2/5
1796,Nollywood Babylon,"Nollywood Babylon seamlessly interweaves actual clips from Nollywood flicks with scenes from the bustling, chaotic markets of Lagos.",3/4
1797,The Way We Get By,I adored every frame of this movie and every person in it.,5/5
1798,Five Minutes of Heaven,"Never taking the easy way out, Five Minutes of Heaven digs down to the very core of twin hell-on-earth existences.",5/5

1805,Après lui,"If Deneuve wasn't in it, the film would be unwatchable.",C
1806,The Poker House,"Regardless of whether the film is all fiction or all true or a mix, it has a ring of truth about it strong enough to sustain a defy-all-odds finish.",4/5
1807,Deadgirl,...it's ultimately hard to work up any real enthusiasm for a film that paints virtually all of its male characters as sleazy rapists with necrophilic tendencies.,1.5/4
1808,The Meerkats,"Despite the involvement of a producer from the BBC's Natural History Unit and the late Paul Newman on voiceover duty, 'The Meerkats' is just another run-of-the-mill wildlife foray.",2/5
1809,Run Robot Run!,"Turns out you can make a robo-comedy today, if you know what you're doing.",3.5/5
1810,Anita O'Day: The Life of a Jazz Singer,"Gimmicks and hyperbole aren't necessary, so long as there's O'Day's beaming face to look at -- radiant when young, radiant and wrinkled when old -- and the sound of that sloe-gin voice to savor.",2.5/4
1811,Carriers,"At 84 minutes, it's a sharp, swift and unrelenting movie. I think it's only going to be out for a week, so please%u2026 GO SEE THIS RIGHT NOW!!! It's surprisingly fantastic.",3.5/4

1815,My One and Only,"Aimed directly at the older audiences who remember when movies effortlessly mixed hilarity, family drama and sentiment without blinking an eye, My One and Only is that rare kind of comedy that doesn't come around very often anymore.",3.5/5

1817,Fifty Dead Men Walking,"Well-acted and visually engaging, the film asks more questions than it answers.",70/100
1818,Nurse.Fighter.Boy,"This risky, rewarding drama blends emotional naturalism with a formal style in the story of its three titular characters -- a young Jamaican-Canadian mother with sickle-cell anemia, an ex-boxer looking for a human connection and a 12-year-old boy.",3/4
1819,Art & Copy,The subjects seem so deluded by a sense of self-importance that they put forth any number of outrageous claims about the significance of their art in order to justify a life spent serving a potentially dubious interest.,1/4
1820,Triangle (Tie saam gok),The film is made confusing not only by the twisting plot but by the varied styles of the three cult directors.,2/5
1821,Franklyn,"The gothic world of the early scenes promises an adventure that never comes. The style is needlessly impenetrable, yet the theme is simple enough.",3/10
1822,Ink,Absolutely one of the best films of 2009.,9.5/10
1823,Passing Strange,"Filmed over a period of three live performances of Stew's and Heidi Rodewald's popular Broadway musical, director Spike Lee beautifully captures the play's vibrant music and energetic physicality toward a priceless cinematic artifact.",A

1825,Staten Island (Little New York),Staten Island has the stench of meat left on the counter for too long.,1.5/4
1826,Kick-Ass,Can this genre make fresh inroads? 'Kick-Ass' proposes an answer of sorts through a marriage of Disney Channel wholesomeness and the kind of foul-mouth dialogue and bloodletting that would make Tarantino proud.,4/5
1827,Motherland,"I have a soft spot for an endeavor such as Motherland, so in some ways I want to give it a pass, but I also realize its limitations, calculations, and glaring omissions. When a movie wants to be uplifting, it had better be true to its vision.",2/5

1836,Paheli,"There's more to recommend: M.M. Kreem's fine music (melding traditional Rajasthani instrumentation and a dancehall beat), a gone-cuckoo-for-the-color-wheel costume and set design, and a truly bang-up camel race. Now that's entertainment.",3/5
1837,Ice People,"In Ice People, director Anne Aghion locates the banal amidst the beautiful solitude of the Antarctic landscape and finds the beauty that emerges between the banality of the routine tasks of the polar explorers who work there.",2.5/4

1839,Shank,"'Shank' has a lot more to say than the average no-budget gangland expos, resulting in a film which, for all its clichs, feels surprisingly real.",3/5
1840,Children of the Corn,"Basically, [Donald P.] Borchers' adaptation of Children of the Corn is one-part nasty bickering, two-parts boring corn chase.",3/10
1841,The Bounty Hunter,"Disappointing, frequently dull and painfully unfunny romcom that's let down by a badly written script, obnoxious characters and a total lack of chemistry between Butler and Aniston.",2/5
1842,Chevolution,"Like the ubiquitous image that it celebrates, this documentary says many things about history, culture and ideology, without ever seeming anything less than clear and compelling.",4/5
1843,Breaking Point,The whole production feels like a rejected Law & Order spec script writ (slightly) larger.,2/5

2095,A Cure For Wellness,This psychological thriller/horror movie needs to be cut by one third to speed up the action. Slow going until the final twenty minutes.,C+
2096,A Dangerous Method,"It's Knightley that one remembers, for a full-on portrayal that is gutsy and potentially divisive in equal parts.",3/5
2097,A Dark Song,A Dark Song is a compelling composition of occult melodies that hits all the right genre highs.,8/10
2098,The Truth (A Dark Truth),A Dark Truth is one of those unfortunate projects whose component parts are immediately at odds with one another.,1/4
2099,A Date with Judy,...a few good tunes are not enough to turn this musical comedy into anything more than lightweight escapist fluff.,5/10
2100,Adrift,The real standout here is newbie Laura Neiva who plays Filipa with a convincing mix of minxy manipulation and blundering vulnerability.,3/5
2101,A Distant Trumpet,This big-budget pic is unfortunately too much a B film and too average to make for a proper farewell pic for the acclaimed filmmaker.,B-
2102,A Dog's Journey,Friendship wears a furry face in this family fable full of love and loyalty which will have dog lovers wagging their tails.,3/5
2103,A Dog's Purpose,A Dog's Purpose goes the Collateral Beauty route by preying on sadness and not earning its emotional reactions.,4/10

2105,A Fantastic Fear of Everything,"While the wheels start spinning in the film's overly drawn-out launderette sequence, they pretty much come off by the final act, when the pacing sags like an old mattress.",3/5

2107,A Farewell to Fools,Dreyer's work is still an enjoyable story that ultimately triumphs as sweet little comedy that doesn't make any attempts to shake up the world of historical cinema.,6.7/10
2108,A Few Best Men,I can't recall too many wedding flicks that have been this crazy and this outlandish. I certainly had a lot of fun watching it!,A-
2109,A Field in England,"Ben Wheatley's strangest movie yet: mysticism, mystification and magic mushrooms in a English Civil War setting. Often confusing, occasionally infuriating - but audaciously original.",4/5
2110,A Fierce Green Fire,Positively inspiring.,3.5/5

2112,A Fond Kiss,[Loach] manages to reach beyond social debate to touch you on an emotional level.,4/5
2113,A Fortunate Man (Lykke-Per),"While there is much to admire about A Fortunate Man, the shortcomings of the script and the emptiness of the lead character are too much to overcome.",3/5
2114,A Four Letter Word,"[Director] Andreas rescues A Four Letter Word from being merely a raunchy lil' romance by showing how his characters are steeped in a culture of therapy that has filled Americans with endless, compulsive self-analysis and self-doubt.",3/4
2115,A Futile and Stupid Gesture,"There's a musicality to Wain's direction that's addicting, and the emotional punch in the final five minutes proves there's a future for the filmmaker that goes way beyond the yucks. In that respect, A Futile and Stupid Gesture is anything but that.",B
2116,A Ghost Story,The interminable pace and crushing desolation will be enough to make anyone want to pass on to the afterlife.,2.5/5
2117,A Girl And A Gun,"Catheryne Czubek's documentary is itself like a shotgun, as its scatter-shot thematic blast is wide and lacking in precision.",1.5/4
2118,A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night,"A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night, is not just a great movie, but should be considered an instant entry into the cannon of vampires on cinema.",A
2119,A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III,The film speeds ahead with almost gleeful disinterest in dealing with the narrative challenges it sets up before resolving them in the most perfunctory ways,1/4
2120,A Good Day To Die Hard,"To say this is the worst of the series doesn't give its unique level of awfulness justice. That's largely because the franchise hasn't had a stinker up to this point, but this is the 'Rocky V' of the beloved franchise and it reeks.",2/10
2121,A Good Woman Is Hard to Find,"A worthy follow-up to the underrated Road Games, A Good Woman Is Hard To Find may leave some viewers looking at single mothers on housing estates with a new respect.",4.5/5
2122,A Gray State,"Clear enough about what happened to be ambiguous about what it means, the film makes only one clean argument: Truth isn't always stranger than fiction, but it's often a hell of a lot sadder.",B

2124,A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints,"If John Cassavetes had made coming-of-age stories, they might have turned out a lot like first-time writer/director Dito Montiel's A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.",4/5
2125,A Guy Thing,"I'm a big Julia Stiles fan; still, this is only a better than average, average film.",2.5/4
2126,A Hard Day,"...its cheerfully nutso inventiveness, the ballsy cycling of ramped-up tension with cathartic release, and not least the many belly laughs it elicited has us feeling completely renewed.",A-
2127,A Haunted House,"A Haunted House really just feels like Scary Movie 4.5, substituting a tad more (just as terrible) story work for random ""celebrity"" cameos and pop-culture jabs.",3/10
2128,A Haunted House 2,"It becomes apparent after only moments that the filmmakers are once more happy to reach for the lowest common denominator, slapping together an icky non-stop barrage of bodily functions, racial stereotyping and rancid epithets and call it a comedy.",0.5/4
2129,A Hijacking,This sharp psychological drama should serve as a calling card for the lean-and-mean director Tobias Lindholm.,3.5/4
2130,A Hologram for the King,"'A Hologram for a King' is that fine and rare thing, a comedy that makes profound observations with the lightest of touches.",8
2131,A Horrible Way to Die,"A smart, low-budget 'road thriller' that goes to some very dark places.",4/5
2132,A Jihad for Love,Perhaps carving enough space for the previously unheard voices of Muslim gays to speak is enough to ask of this socially groundbreaking work.,2.5/4
2133,A Kid Like Jake,"This might be the start of a long and winding path, but it's no small thing for A Kid Like Jake to so clearly illustrate how love is always going to be the path of least resistance.",B-
2134,A Kind of Murder,A promising period piece murder mystery that's been production designed to death.,2/4
2135,A La Mala,"Cute, pretty, but alas not ""mala"" (cruel) enough.",2/4
2136,A Late Quartet,...ultimately far from the arm's-length and somber piece of work one might've anticipated.,3.5/4
2137,A League of Ordinary Gentlemen,"Great characters, big laughs and a helluva climax all combine to make this one of the most entertaining sports documentaries ever made.",3.5/4
2138,A Letter to Momo,"It offers a realistic portrayal of Momo's emotional state, but this comes at the expense of a deeper exploration into both the story's lush supernatural landscape and its inhabitants.",2.5/4
2139,A Liar's Autobiography - The Untrue Story of Monty Python's Graham Chapman,...an aggressively narrow-minded documentary.,0.5/4
2140,A Little Bit Of Heaven,"Poorly directed, ill-conceived, hideously unfunny romcom-slash-disease-of-the-week movie...",2/5
2141,A Little Chaos,"It has to be said, the performances are excellent. Winslet manages emotional honesty within anachronistic confines, and Schoenaerts escapes with dignity.",3/5
2142,A Little Trip to Heaven,...needlessly arty...,1.5/4
2143,A Lonely Place to Die,"Bounding o'er hill and dale, this energetic chase thriller barely pauses for plausibility, pitting climbers against kidnappers in the Scottish Highlands.",3/5
2144,A Long Way Down,"The film is one long rictus of denial. It's wholly doomed, but it puts on a brave face.",1/5
2145,A Long Way From Home,"Adroit performances abound in this ex-pat tale. Archipelago DP Ed Rutherford helps add to the Joanna Hogg-y feel, but this lacks the disquieting insights of Hogg's work.",3/5
2146,A Man and a Woman,an interesting piece of film history... that's lost much of its luster,3/5
2147,A Man Called Ove (En man som heter Ove),"It's emotionally manipulative, but its two leads find a core of humanity even in the most calculating plot machinations.",2.5/4
2148,A Man Escaped (Un condamné à mort s'est échappé ou Le vent souffle où il veut),It's so good that I submit that just about anyone -- even people who hate French films -- will love it.,4/4
2149,A Man Named Pearl,"The film's hero is charismatic: modest, thoughtful, well-spoken, pointing out he achieved remarkable things because he didn't know he wasn't supposed to be able to do them.",3/4
2150,A Man's Story,"Sadly, rather than provide insight into Boateng's creative process, director Varon Bonicos is dazzled by the globetrotting, celeb-schmoozing lifestyle.",2/5
2151,A Marine Story,"A plodding B-movie that exploits ""don't ask, don't tell"" with cheap psychology and cheaper thrills.",1/4
2152,A Master Builder,"There's an overall lifelessness to A Master Builder, as if Demme were embalming the Shawn-Gregory stage show rather than making it live onscreen.",3/5

2154,A Midsummer Night's Dream,This Dream is still out of this world.,4/5

2156,A Million Ways to Die in the West,You have to do a little trash diving but it excels when deconstructing the Western genre,3/5
2157,A Monster Calls,"Filmmaker J.A. Bayona goes three for three with A Monster Calls, a movie more steeped in fantasy and fairy tale than his previous one.",4.5/5
2158,A Monster in Paris,"The animation is charming, the musical numbers rather sweet, but the plot struggles for excitement, unexpected twists or comic moments.",2/5
2159,A Month Of Sundays,...one can only hope that this marks a temporary stumble for an otherwise talented filmmaker.,2/4
2160,A Most Violent Year,"I think this is a pretty major piece of adult emotional entertainment, something special, and I hope we get a lot more like it from him.",A
2161,A Most Wanted Man,"As ever, le Carre subverts the spy genre in a major way.",8.3/10
2162,A Murder In The Park,Its wholly complex and provocative social pleas slip too frequently into the seedy realm of journalistic exploitation.,2.5/4
2163,The Notebook,"An original, a war movie like none you've seen before--about a pair of twin boys who imitate the behavior of the cruel adults they see during the German occupation of Hungary.",A-
2164,A Nice Girl Like You,"As sex farces go, ""A Nice Girl Like You"" is about as nasty, dirty and funny as a sitcom...on The Disney Channel.",1.5/4
2165,A Night In Old Mexico,Robert Duvall's excellent performance as a cantankerous rancher makes A Night In Old Mexico a night to remember.,8/10
2166,A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge,"The script is very shallow, with blood and gore to satisfy the audience, and very little dialogue, which, if there had been more, would have helped the script develop appropriately.",2.5/4

2173,A Perfect Day,"Inconsistency is A Perfect Day's biggest problem. The script is scalpel sharp in some places, flabby as the well-blocker in others.",3/5
2174,A Perfect Getaway,"Prides itself on a clever twist and a few great red herrings. You know how I know? Because it actually tells us. Literally. As in, in the dialogue.",4/10
2175,A Perfect Man,"In its elliptical presentation of its characters' lives, brings to mind the latter-day films of Philippe Garrel, but Kees Van Oostrum's genre experimentation aligns him with Paul Verhoeven.",3/4
2176,A Place at the Table,The film explains with devastating simplicity why so many go hungry in a country with more than enough food to go round.,5/5
2177,A Plumm Summer,"A proud throwback to '70s family melodramas, such as Where the Red Fern Grows, Plumm seems slow, melodramatic and contrived when compared to contemporary movies.",1.5/4
2178,A Poem Is A Naked Person,"Even Les Blank's most conventional work remains an elusive vision, punctuated by cultural insights that elude many filmmakers for their entire careers.",3.5/4
2179,A Prayer Before Dawn,"No one would accuse it of breaking new ground, or finding fascinating new paths across its well-worn prison yard. But Sauvaire's drama is lean and trim and unwavering in its task.",3/5
2180,A Prayer for the Dying,A ludicrous movie about a subject that deserves more serious treatment.,1/4
2181,A Private Function,"Entertains, but never dazzles or impresses us with its script, performances, or even production design.",6/10
2182,A Private War,"An intense, harrowing drama betrayed by a campy Rosamund Pike performance.",C-
2183,A Promise,"More than anything else, Leconte's bland chocolate-box romance resembles a film like The Notebook or The Lucky One, with its thwarted romance, chaste lack-of-sexuality and thin characters.",D+
2184,A Question of Faith,A very moving tale of redemption which not only reveals God's grace but makes a case for cross-cultural tolerance that's sorely-needed in these divided times.,4/4
2185,A Quiet Passion,"In its depiction of physical pain, the film rekindles memories both of Bergman's Cries And Whispers and of the death scene in Davies's own Distant Voices, Still Lives.",5/5
2186,A Quiet Place,"Directed with first-rate visual flair by John Krasinski (who knew?), this riveting near-silent thriller exudes the despair of a broken world with the concision of a Cormac McCarthy novel folded into a simplistic B-movie premise.",B+
2187,A Reindeer's Journey,"Captivating reindeer docu has natural beauty, perils.",5/5
2188,A Room With a View,"It is an intellectual film, but intellectual about emotions: It encourages us to think about how we feel, instead of simply acting on our feelings.",4/4
2189,A Royal Night Out,"There are pale shades of '80s yuppie comedies, too, like Something Wild and After Hours, but those films deliver their kicks from seeing stiff collars come completely undone. Throughout, Lilibet is just too decorous.",2/5
2190,A Score to Settle,"Cage gives what he can to the low-budget endeavor, but director Shawn Ku can't shake the stiffness of the effort, which buries a few of its better ideas with crude filmmaking and lackluster casting.",C-
2191,A Screaming Man,"A moving new film by one of Africa's best directors, A Screaming Man won the jury prize at Cannes last year and deserves a wider audience than the continent's great movies often achieve.",4/5
2192,A Secret Love,A Secret Love is profound.,A-
2193,A Separation,"Impressively shot and acted, A Separation refuses to judge its characters: everyone here has their reasons.",4/5
2194,A Serious Man,"That leaves us in limbo -- laughing yes, but also wondering what to make of a film so simultaneously engaging and disengaging.",3/4
2195,A Shaun the Sheep Movie: Farmageddon,"Farmageddon happily retains the inventive action of the early classic shorts, and there is more than enough in the frame to hold the attention throughout.",9/10
2196,A Short History Of Decay,Modest but winsome.,3/4
2197,A Simple Favor,"...classy in its aesthetic, crisp in its framing and delivery, and confrontational yet seductive in its mood.",15/20
2198,A Simple Life,"A Simple Life is moving and well made, but it could use a little emotional grit and, while we're at it, a sense of humor.",2.5/4
2199,A Simple Wedding,"Not one of the love- searching souls in the film seem to know at all what they're doing, and that's the truest part. Love is messy, and it's damned confusing.",8/10
2200,A Single Girl,"...if you were to fast-forward all the scenes where there is no talking, just walking, you'd be left with a very short movie.",2.5/4
2201,A Single Shot,"Its portrait of foolishness and fallibility, and its atmosphere of inevitable doom, remain sturdy and captivating.",3/4
2202,A Sinner in Mecca,"Shots of the masses of pilgrims are spectacular, especially those of the millions circling the Kaaba, one of five required rituals, but the emotional core of the film is what stands out: Sharma's identity crisis as a devout gay Muslim.",4/5
2203,A Skin So Soft (Ta peau si lisse),"All about will and the focusing of it beyond all reason, it's both fascinating and revolting to watch these people punish themselves in the name of perfection.",3/5
2204,A Slipping-Down Life,Confirms what many art-house moviegoers of the '90s have suspected for some time now: that Lili Taylor is perhaps the best American actress of her generation.,4/5
2205,A Smile Like Yours,"Writer-director Keith Samples has pieced together scraps of bad sperm jokes, an inane 'rags-to-riches' story line, and a boring extra-marital affair for 'intrigue.'",15/100
2206,A Song for Martin,"From its invitingly upbeat overture to its pathos-filled but ultimately life-affirming finale, Martin is a masterfully conducted work.",5/5
2207,A Space Program,"The film's larger purpose, be it about the ardor of handmade crafts or artist Tom Sachs's artistic ambitions, never emerges with any consistent focus.",2.5/4
2208,A Star Is Born,"Calling the new A Star Is Born a ""valentine"" from its star, Lady Gaga, to her fans sounds a bit coy and delicate, so let's call it what it really is: a hot French kiss (with full-on tongue), filled with passion, tears and a staggering amount of chutzpah.",4/5
2209,A Street Cat Named Bob,"What works on the page seems slight on screen. That's not to say it isn't life-affirming, it's just not quite the cat's pyjamas.",3/5
2210,A Suitable Girl,"We're left with a stunted perspective of arranged marriages: if anything, the film seems to argue that the whole process of parental matchmaking is an endurable hassle that inevitably leads to happy marriages.",5/10
2211,A Summer In Genoa,"[Winterbottom] can't quite decide which well-trodden path to walk, either of domestic drama or of supernatural riddle, which should have been a sign that he hasn't really committed to this project.",C
2212,A Sun,"Powerful, mature family drama with violence, swearing.",4/5
2213,A Tale of Love and Darkness,"It has an unusual, and possibly unique, perspective on Israeli psychology, and Portman demonstrates she possesses a confident grasp of film-making fundamentals.",3/5
2214,A Tale of Two Sisters,"Haunting presences, inexplicable cutaways, overwhelming suspense, deeply disturbing sub-themes and a general willingness to leave things unanswered. Fantastic!",3.5/5
2215,A Teacher,"The premise is attractive, but the execution is unfinished. Lindsay Burdge as the teacher who falls for her student makes this undiscovered indie worthwhile. But while we have reason to believe she's smart, we never understand why she's so stupid.",3.5/5
2216,The A-Team,The A-Team overstays its welcome and misses the mark on too many occasions for it to fulfil its initial promise of consistent entertainment.,2.5/5
2217,A Thousand Kisses Deep,"It's brimming with bold ideas but none entirely come off, despite a willing cast and solid performances from the leads.",2/5
2218,A Thousand Words,"The high point of the movie, for me, was when I got up from my seat and walked over to a guy who was texting in the theater and asked him to shut his phone off.",1/4
2219,A Thousand Years of Good Prayers,Modest in the least engaging sense of the term.,2/4
2220,A Thread of Deceit: The Hart Family Tragedy,"Analyzes the tragedy in a sensitive and balanced fashion, employing a wide array of archival material and extensive interviews.",B
2221,A Touch of Sin,"The horizon-stretching scenery, shimmeringly captured by cinematographer Yu Lik-Wai, will make you draw breath, in awe but also fear.",4/5
2222,A Town Called Panic (Panique au village),"An amazing head trip, a glorious journey right inside a semi-innocent imagination",10/10
2223,A Tuba to Cuba,"What the Preservation Hall Jazz Band ... learn and experience, is the true power of music in its ability to cross over the language barrier and connect us through a rhythm which runs through us all.",4.5/5
2224,A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures,"The story doesn't do anything near enough to keep you involved for the 88-minute runtime, aimlessly meandering forward without even a whiff of narrative structure.",1/5
2225,A United Kingdom,"Exactly the film you imagine it's going to be: handsome, honey-coloured and simplistic.",3/5
2226,A Very British Gangster,"At times, MacIntyre's narrative abilities in making the Manchester gangster life-style appear glamorous makes you question how much of the film is real, but when you get down to it, the reality here is between the lines.",3.5/4
2227,A Very Long Engagement,"The epic of mystery-unravelling, which at times is Rashomon-like in its variations of witness accounts, is folded into a piece of film art that is visually rich.",4/5
2228,A Very Sordid Wedding,You'll get a gay rights sermon with your booze and cigarettes and Southern charm the way the good lord intended.,8/10
2229,A Vigilante,"Not only does Daggar-Nickson reimagine a reductive reverie into one of harrowing, feminine empowerment, but she does so in a way that is wary of violence, even while using it to defang the type of toxic masculinity that has long wallowed in this genre.",4/5
2230,A Violent Man,"A thriller that punches above its weight. There are some twists and turns that I wasn't expecting; and to director Matthew Berkowitz's credit, it's a film that follows through on its promises to the very end.",3/5
2231,A Violent Separation,"A promising B-movie thriller the filmmakers can never quite bring themselves to edit into this slow, cluttered picture into the lean little neo-noir it wants to be.",1.5/4
2232,A Wake In Providence (Almost Married),"for all the well-aimed blows it lands about how families make us crazy, it still has a very warm, very soft spot for these lunatics.",3/5
2233,A Walk Among the Tombstones,Overlong with a labyrinthine plot but Liam Neeson's performance makes viewing worthwhile.,B
2234,A Walk In The Woods,Another comedy that tries too hard for laughs and ends up with a batting average below 50%.,6/10
2235,A Walk Into the Sea: Danny Williams and the Warhol Factory,"Inspired by her grandmother to make a film about Williams, Robinson painstakingly makes the case that her uncle was exploited by Warhol as well as by fellow Factory workers, yet she doesn't quite justify a feature-length film about his brief career.",2.5/4
2236,A War (Krigen),"This is a real 'What would you do?' movie, the sort you'll be turning over in your mind for days after, and the result is first-rate.",4/5
2237,A Warrior's Heart,A ho-hum drama whose many moving parts feel decidedly recycled.,1/5
2238,A Whale of a Tale,"Animal rights activists will rejoice while traditional Japanese fisherman will be outraged by this effective story of the struggle to ban the exploitation in a small Japanese town of whales. A sequel to the Oscar-winning doc ""The Cove.""",B+

2240,"A White, White Day (Hvítur, hvítur dagur)",A seriously strange movie...,2.5/4
2241,A Will For The Woods,"A Will for the Woods will help build awareness of the movement while also telling an immersive (for everyone, including the embedded filmmakers), heartwarming tale of one man's passionate struggle to find both peace on earth and peace in earth...""",3.5/5
2242,A Wizard's Tale (Here Comes the Grump),The movie is full of wackiness but contains only traces of comedy.,2/5
2243,A Wolf at the Door (O Lobo atrás da Porta),...a slow-moving and hopelessly irrelevant drama...,1.5/4
2244,"A Woman, A Gun and a Noodle Shop (San qiang pai an jing qi) (A Simple Noodle Story) (The First Gun)",Yimou's overdone compositions lend a cartoonish quality to the proceedings that sap it of most of its punch.,41/100
2245,A Woman Is a Woman (Une femme est une femme),"Jean-Luc Godard's A Woman is A Woman, along with his great My Life to Live, remains one of the director's more accessible works.",3.5/4
2246,A Woman of Paris: A Drama of Fate,The soap opera love triangle story takes the form of a morality play and is well-constructed but hardly substantial.,B-
2247,A Wrinkle in Time,"Mostly, it's just a frustrating whole comprised of some pretty promising parts.",2/4
2248,Aarakshan,"Subtle it ain't and subtle it needn't be. It is, though, mostly involving (if Bollywood long, at 2 hours 45 minutes) and even occasionally stirring.",3.5/5
2249,Aardvark,The film adopts a half-hearted variation on A Beautiful Mind's gimmicky approach to grappling with a man's mental illness.,1/4
2250,Ab-normal Beauty,...the film...devolves...into...standard slasher movie fare.,4/10
2251,Abandon,"In burying elements of behavioral psychology below a dozen different shades of blue, Gaghan draws attention away from the fact that there's a trick pony at play here.",2.5/4

2256,Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy,The boys were really winding down with this one...,2.5/5
2257,ABCs of Death 2,"The ABCs Of Death 2 has something for the deviant in all of us, assembling another winning collection boasting sick, twisted, psychotic fun.",8/10
2258,Abduction,"Last I checked, tweenage girls weren't too keen on this genre, and the boys who normally would be a fan will likely be disappointed by [Abduction's] bloodless, stagnant lameness.",2/5
2259,Abe,This one was a bit of a mixed bag for me. I loved everything with Abe...but the adults in the family left something to be desired...But in the end Abe is a strong enough character to carry his movie,6/10
2260,Abe & Phil's Last Poker Game,"The Last Poker Game is an unexpectedly warm movie, shot with a honed sense of visual storytelling-especially given the director's newness with all this-and an eye for textures, but one which flames out into a terribly overwrought ending.",6.9/10
2261,Abe Lincoln in Illinois,"John Cromwell's historically inaccurate biopic, which is inferior to Ford's Young Mr. Lincoln, was nonetheless nominated for two Oscars: Raymond Massey and cinematography.",B-
2262,Abel,"Abel is blighted by limp plotting and anaemic characters, leaving it as flat as a steamrollered tortilla.",2/5
2263,Aberdeen,Directed with a fierce honesty by Norwegian Hans Petter Moland .,B
2264,Abominable,Abominable lacks the personality to distinguish it from superior animated films that cover most of the same ground.,2/4
2265,About a Boy,"It's the perfect star vehicle for Grant, allowing him to finally move away from his usual bumbling, tongue-tied screen persona.",4/5
2266,About Adam,Instantly and immediately likable. But that's all it is.,2.5/4
2267,About Alex,"Writer/director Jesse Zwick shows promise, and as a first feature, the film is impressive, but it's not likely to stay with you after the credits roll.",3/5
2268,About Cherry,Never boring but never as engaging as it could or should be.,2.5/4
2269,About Elly,"By allowing a slow-build to his drama, Asghar Farhadi ensures we get a feel for the extended family dynamic before wrong-footing the characters and his audience with the suddeness and deftness of a heartbeat.",4/5
2270,About Last Night,"A marriage between the creative talents of David Mamet and Edward Zwick might seem to be an unlikely union but, in the case of 1986 feature About Last Night..., it is surprisingly effective.",3/4
2271,About Last Night,"... by refusing to play to the typical roadblocks of the genre, the film manages to offer people something honest, and... couples will recognize themselves in the film.",B+
2272,About Schmidt,The dialogue and characters are fantastic and Nicholson's reactions in every scene are perfect.,3/5
2273,About Scout,"There are plot holes galore, but the actors have terrific chemistry and make you care about their characters.",3/5
2274,About Time,"Even that hoariest of old staples, the romantic downpour, is fresh and exhilarating this time round.",3/5
2275,Above the Law,"It might be arguable whether it is the best Seagal film or not, but Nico still has all important Seagal trademarks.",6/10
2276,Above the Rim,"The movie lives easily on the streets where it is shot, and the performances -- especially by Martin, Shakur and Pinkins -- are convincing.",3/4
2277,Above the Shadows,"Slow-burn fantasy/romance has some sex, sports violence.",3/5
2278,Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter,"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter's heart may be in the right place -- and any film that makes people interested in reading up on the real Lincoln must be commended -- but overall the film is, ironically, bloodless.",5.5/10
2279,Absence,The tension almost immediately leaks out of the narrative once we realize we're watching a found-footage horror movie.,0.5/4
2280,Absence Of Malice,"Another bash the media film, but 15 years before its time.",3.5/5
2281,Absentia,"A melancholy tale of loss that's only peripherally a horror flick, but a good one all the same.",3.5/5
2282,The Absent-Minded Professor,The original's simple humor looks remarkably tired compared with the story's energetic and much more inventive remake.,2.5/4
2283,Absolute Power,There's something garish and degrading about a thriller that's this lip-smackingly eager to transmute sleaze into murder.,C
2284,Absolute Wilson,"For the Wilson newbie, this puff piece will suffice as an introduction.",2.5/4
2285,Absolutely Anything,"It's all on Pegg and his goofy charisma to keep things moving. He may not be omnipotent, but he's gifted enough to save the day.",3/5
2286,Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie,"Basically, Joanna Lumley saves this film: she has an imperishable hauteur and comedy-charisma. She is the garden bridge that stops this film from collapsing into the Thames.",3/5
2287,Absurdistan,Full of whimsy but almost devoid of charm.,2/5
2288,Abuse of Weakness,"It's as if Breillat is determined to make the same mistakes all over again, botching her own would be exorcism.",C
2289,Accattone (The Procurer) (The Scrounger),"Powerful, gripping, urgent.",4/5
2290,Acceleration,"Nothing can save Dolph Lundgren from C-grade hell, digital squibs, and schlocky crime flicks like Acceleration.",0.5/5
2291,Accepted,"Comes with a few funny moments, but probably not enough to justify going out of your way to verify their existence.",2.5/5
2292,Accident Man,"While a few flaws prevent it from hitting its full stride, it is as fun as that team up makes it sound. Stylized directing and great action scenes make this a treat for Adkins fans and genre enthusiasts alike.",B+
2293,The Accidental Husband,The prognosis: a total emotional block.,2/5
2294,Accidental Love,"What should have been a smart political farce is instead a slapstick nightmare, record skip and all, whose laughs are too dependent on volume",F
2295,The Accidental Spy (Te wu mi cheng),"A little less extreme than in the past, with longer exposition sequences between them, and with fewer gags to break the tedium.",2.5/5
2296,The Accidental Tourist,"Hurt is the virtuoso, rising above the Lawrence Kasdan histrionics and some loose acting.",3.5/5
2297,Accidents Happen,"I think this is an extraordinary film, it's like no other I can think of in this country's history.",4/4
2298,According To Greta,"Misfires when it should've soared, and while Hilary Duff gives the role a forceful middle-finger twinkle, it's wasted on unsophisticated ABC Family leftovers.",D

2300,Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"God help me, I laughed quite a bit.",6/10
2301,Ace Ventura - When Nature Calls,"There's so little to watch besides Carrey, in fact, it makes you actually miss (gasp!) Sean Young from Ace 1.",2/4
2302,Aces: Iron Eagle III,"Makes the original ""Iron Eagle"" look like ""Ben-Hur""",2/5
2303,A.C.O.D.,"Zicherman, who also directed the film, has brought together a strong comedic cast, but he also utilizes them well to create a funny film that even those of us who are not A.C.O.D.s (see: me) can relate to.",B+
2304,Acolytes,...maddeningly uneven...,2.5/4
2305,Across 110th Street,Dated crime drama headed by top cast including Anthony Quinn.,3/5
2306,Across the Universe,"This ambitious musical balances its visual outrageousness with a moving story. It's a little exhausting, but also wonderful.",4.5/5
2307,Act of God,"Act of God fearlessly approaches the natural and the supernatural, and the result is visceral, intellectual, heartbreaking, delightful and instructive, all at once.",5/5
2308,Act of Valor,"This is a videogame with killer effects on automatic play, not a solid feature.",2/5
2309,Action Jackson,"Action Jackson is a movie where some of the parts are good, but none of them fit and a lot of them stink.",1/4
2310,Action Point,"As with Knoxville's surprisingly likable Bad Grandpa, this movie is appealing and often funny, in a reckless, naughty way.",3/5
2311,Action Replayy,Bollywood time travel romcom has iffy gender roles.,2/5
2312,Active Measures,"Bryan's done some good and noble work. But until investigative committees provide him with the final act of this story, the rest of us will just have to hold out for the pee tape.",3/5
2313,Acts of Vengeance,[It] rushes past what could have made the movie intriguing in order to get to the formula...,1.5/4
2314,Acts of Violence,"The title ""Acts of Violence"" has less to do with the storyline of the movie it graces and more about what's perpetrated against the audience watching it.",1.5/5
2315,Acts of Worship,"Some of the acting may not be the best and many of the points aren't made with a soft touch, but damn, I can't think of another film about addiction with a more accurate view from the inside.",4/5
2316,Ad Astra,"Sublime and stupendous. Beautiful, bold and remarkably executed, this is Gray's masterpiece, driven by a career-best turn from Pitt.",5/5
2317,Adam,"This gentle comedy likely won't achieve a big level of chatter, but there's value in its earnest and authentic take on the coming-of-age film.",B
2318,Adam Resurrected,Goldblum's performance as Adam is complex and engrossing to watch ...,3.5/5
2319,Adam Sandler: 100% Fresh,"If 100% Fresh doesn't give you the kind of laughs you like, it will at the very least provide that perspective.",7.5/10
2320,Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights,The songs are rather forgettable and sometimes downright painful.,1.5/5
2321,Adam's Apples,We have a comedy black enough to make even the most jaded viewer cringe a little.,4/5
2322,The Addams Family,At times this can all become a little silly but Sonnenfeld manages to rein the film in before things get too ridiculous.,3/5
2323,Addams Family Values,"Overall this is a far tighter film, from the simpler but ever delightful set design to the sharp script and economical running time.",4/5
2324,Addicted,"If one squints hard enough, all the nudity and grinding might retain appeal, but for those who can't switch their brain off, the picture is maddeningly inconsistent and comically performed.",D+
2325,Addicted To Fame,"[A] hapless, clueless, necrophiliac documentary ...",D
2326,Addicted to Love,"What bothered me more was that the characters are supposed to be intelligent, and yet they have the maturity of gnats. It is always a problem in a love story when the rival seems more interesting than the hero, and that's what happens here.",2/4
2327,Addiction Incorporated,Hard-hitting doc takes aim against the lies of the tobacco industry.,B
2328,Adieu au langage (Goodbye to Language),"Is it difficult, abrasive and pretentious? Absolutely. But there are worse things to be than any of those.",B
2329,The Adjustment Bureau,"Despite wobbling under the weight of some hefty ideas while straddling two genres, this sci-fi mystery surprises by emerging as a sweet, star-powered romance.",3/5
2330,Admiral (Michiel de Ruyter),Perfunctory historical Dutch bio-pic benefiting from epic scale and impressive lead performances.,2.5/4
2331,Admission,Off the likability charts,8/10
2332,Adopt a Highway,"Adopt a Highway fails to ground its fable-esque qualities in a deeper bedrock of emotional truth, but its best moments offer a tender glimpse at what people do with several decades of pent-up resentment.",C+
2333,Adoration,...ultimately overcomes an almost disastrously plodding opening half hour to become a slight yet somewhat engaging piece of work.,2.5/4
2334,Adore,"Fontaine is a capable director...But the moment that the dialogue begins, any nuance is lost, with key emotional moments generating laughter rather than empathy.",2/5
2335,Adrift,The back-and-forth flashbacks weaken the intensity of the struggle and a weak script and weaker twist ending make even a story of survival more disappointing than inspiring.,C
2336,Adrift in Manhattan,Throw a rock into any year's Sundance guide and you're guaranteed to hit at least two or three multi-pronged grave and oh-so-earnest weep-dramas like this one.,3/5
2337,Adult Beginners,"It's not perfect, but as far as feature debuts go, there's very little you can fault ""Adult Beginners"" for. Slightly pedantic and maudlin at times, with telegraphed metaphors and rushed pacing, it's still hard to call any of these hiccups major flaws.",B+
2338,Adult World,"Cusack makes a fine, cynical and aging poet, and Emma Roberts is well-cast as the Sylvia Plath wannabe who hangs on his every word.",2.5/4
2339,Advanced Style,"Advanced Style is a fun and sunny documentary about fashion mavens in their golden years, proving, as always, that age ain't nothing but a number.",8/10
2340,Adventureland,"Jesse Eisenberg's heartfelt performance is the main reason to see this ultra-familiar youth tale of first love, in which most of the characters are types and all the adults stereotypes.",B-
2341,Adventures in Babysitting,This is really just innocent material with a tendency to flout basic guidelines and stray from the perimeters of believability.,2.5/4
2342,Adventures in Babysitting,"It's not the raucous fun of the original, but the message more closely reflects the morals of Disney... But it's not quite ""Disney-ified,"" either. Marriage isn't the end goal, nor is romance, really.",B-
2343,Adventures in Public School (Public Schooled),"Grace Park and Andrea Bang steal every one of their scenes as a mother-child pairing even odder than Greer and Doheny, and Andrew McNee is a stealthy delight as Liam's officious, easily distracted principal.",4/5

2370,After Everything (Shotgun),"A strong debut by Marks and Power because of its so disarmingly pleasant countenance, which flies in direct contradiction of its heavy subject matter of illness.",4/5
2371,"After Fall, Winter",A remarkably honest and sometimes rather grim look at the dark side of love and sex.,3.5/5

2375,After Louie,Even though the film has a plodding pace there are flashes of honesty and brilliance that make this film worth a passive look.,2/4
2376,After Love (L'économie du couple),"After Love is an unusually moderate film by Lafosse's standards. While it ultimately lacks some of the vigor of his previous work, it does allow you to leave the cinema without feeling ill, which is also nice.",B
2377,After Lucia,After Lucia is an uncomfortable and disturbing experience with a vengeful sting in the tail that sinks our already taut and wrung out emotions into even more chilling waters.,4/5
2378,After Midnight (Something Else),"Something Else is more of a rumination on modern relationships than it is a full-blooded genre film, which is what I enjoyed so much about it, making its title wholly indicative of just what kind of experience awaits fans as Gardner's story unfolds.",4/5
2379,After Stonewall,"""Lesbians! We're everywhere! Lesbiana! Yo soy lesbiana!""",2.5/4
2380,After the Ball,It's pretty much a one-joke effort that wants to be The Devil Wears Prada but plays more like a middling episode of a TV sitcom.,2/4

2387,After the Wedding,After the Wedding is a showcase for Williams and Moore to sink into the emotional weight of the characters. Would you ever need more than that?,7/10
2388,After Tiller,They're not heroes and they're not demons. After Tiller is an important reminder of the personal stories of doctors and mothers that can get lost in an issue as divisive as abortion.,4/5
2389,After We Leave,"Once in a while, a budget indie film comes along that makes us glad this art form is still around. After We Leave is a shining example of indie filmmaking at its finest.",9/10

2394,Aftermath,"After a depressingly anonymous start, the rebirth of Arnie finally hits its stride with a great, low key performance that should get him back to where he belongs in the public consciousness.",4/5
2395,Afternoon Delight,"It winds up being one of the biggest tonal messes - comically, dramatically and morally - that is ultimately like trying to watch a Judd Apatow production of Shame.",2/4
2396,Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq,"While it does profile the work of brilliant dancer, the film also contains two complex and moving love stories as well an account of a physically devastating tragedy followed by an extraordinary tale of struggle and survival.",3.5/4

2416,The Agony and the Ecstasy,"For some viewers, the agony will be watching Charlton Heston (over)act, and the ecstasy Rex Harrison. But it IS refreshing for a period film to cover such new and (pun intended) artistic ground.",7/10

2432,Air Force One,Preposterous but viscerally juicy,3/4
2433,Air Guitar Nation,"I wouldn't exactly call Air Guitar Nation the next important documentary, but as a colorful look at an admittedly goofy activity, the flick's a pleasant little winner.",4/5
2434,Air Strike,"With a shoddy edit and a poor storyline, the only reason to watch the film is for its elaborate fight action sequences. Besides that, there's nothing more to look forward to in this uninspiring World War II drama.",2.5/5

2444,Akira,Akira will appropriately smash you in all the right places.,4/5
2445,I Saw the Devil,"I could talk for hours about the film, but nothing I can say will ever do it justice. The film is an experience; it's something that will have you emotionally invested in the characters, while also covering your eyes at the extreme violence.",4.5/5
2446,Akron,The best and worst thing about the movie is that you could probably change Benny and Christopher to a heterosexual couple and not have to change a single line of the screenplay.,2.5/5
2447,Aladdin,"The wonder of Aladdin is impressively realised and though it lacks some of the magic, there is plenty to sit back and soak in, with laughs and singalongs guaranteed.",3/5
2448,Aladdin and the King of Thieves,...a movie that happens before it thinks.,0.5/4
2449,Alamar (To the Sea),Alamar is as much about the way a coat of yellow paint looks spread across wooden planks as it is the tender regard a father bestows on his son or the manner by which a lobster is speared and stripped.,3/4
2450,The Alamo,The filmmakers have obviously decided to use as their model those educational films. . .that are inflicted on soon to be history-hating students at the middle school level,1/5
2451,Alan Partridge,This is the Alan Partridge film that Alan Partridge would make.,3/5

2454,Albino Alligator,"Pretentious and show-offy, the noirish drama fairly reeks of film-student overkill.",2/4
2455,Aleksandr Nevskiy (Alexander Nevsky),a complete work of art that also functioned as a rallying cry for a burgeoning socialist nation under constant threat from fascism in the form of Nazi Germany,4/4
2456,Alex & Emma,The overall effect is not unlike watching a film with the DVD commentary track already incorporated into the script.,1.5/4
2457,Alex Cross,"The relentless ugliness of the story isn't thrilling or involving, and its vague undercurrent of misogyny makes it even more off-putting.",1/5

2459,Alex Rider: Operation Stormbreaker,"There's so much potential within, but it's terribly squandered. And that's a real shame.",2/5
2460,Alex Strangelove,"Landing somewhere between Love, Simon and Superbad, Alex Strangelove is a strange delight indeed.",B
2461,Alexander,This half-cocked creation is ostensibly about the Macedonian king but doubles as an allegory for both George W. Bush's political career and Stone's own struggle with history.,2.5/4
2462,"Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day","It's a fine example of the kind of ""kid-centric"" live-action entertainment that has become an endangered species as the industry has focused on ""for all ages"" PG-13 fantasy spectaculars.",7/10
2463,Alexander the Last,"What looks like a drama of adultery turns out to be an exploration of how the spaces between people can separate them or join them, often at the same moment.",A-
2464,Alexander's Ragtime Band,"Easily a tune every few minutes, all reliably executed, but the film's insistence on musical comprehensiveness leaves room only for the barest of character development.",62/100
2465,Alexandra's Project,One of the year's true surprise packages..will have you gasping for breath right up until the very last cinematic shock,4/5
2466,Alfie,"Like its hero, the film looks good but can't commit, talks the talk but has nothing to say.",2/5
2467,Algorithms,"...while these disparate parts are compelling on a surface level, Algorithms is unable to cohere into a decent, coherent, and consistently paced whole.",C-

2472,Alice Adams,"Alice Adams (1935) is RKO's touching, effectively poignant portrayal of small-town, mid-Western American pretenses in the early 1900s. The film's screenplay (by Dorothy Yost and Mortimer Offner) was based...",A
2473,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is an American comedy of the sort of vitality that dazzles European film critics and we take for granted.,5/5
2474,Alice Through the Looking Glass,"Depp grimaces and prances in his mad Scottish-kabuki drag, Hathaway flutters like a glittery sparrow, and Bonham Carter brings bite and pathos to her Red Queen.",B-
2475,Alice Neel,[It's] more than a mere biography of an important 20th-century artist: It's also an intimate portrait of a family member that questions whether or not 'great artist' and 'good parent' can ever be combined in the same person.,3/4
2476,"Alice, Sweet Alice (Communion)",Possibly the closet American relation to an Italian giallo.,3.5/4
2477,Alien,"In space, the famous tagline went, no one can hear you scream. In Alien, you can hear lessons for the sci-fi future in a great milestone from the recent past.",A
2478,Alien Autopsy,"This is never less than watchable, but it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama and ends up failing as both.",3/5
2479,Alien3,"A grimly seductive end-of-the-world thriller, with pop-tragic overtones that build in resonance as the movie goes on.",A-
2480,Alien Abduction,"A found-footage knock-off of ""The Blair Witch Project"" that grows more shameless by the minute.",1/4
2481,Alien: Covenant,A self-contained science fiction blockbuster that thrives in its simplistic premise.,3/5
2482,Alien Nation,"This plot contains the elements of a good idea, but it does so little with it, and is so cheerfully willing to recycle an absolutely standard story, that the idea is finally just frustrating.",2/4
2483,Alien Outpost,The film splits its time evenly between half-heartedly pretending it's an allegory for our current war on terror and pretending that it's not.,1.5/4
2484,Alien Raiders,"Suffice to say that Alien Raiders has a few modest surprises up its sleeve, and that's more than most low-budget genre concoctions even attempt.",3.5/5
2485,Alien Resurrection,Spastically intriguing but ultimately empty experience.,C
2486,Alien Trespass,"What starts out as a promising retro comic spoof of '50s era sci-fi movies (think ""It Came From Outer Space"") digresses into a flat imitation of the mores and social ignorance it initially promises to skewer.",C+
2487,AVP - Alien Vs. Predator,It certainly delivers as a loving homage to two of our favorite monsters and their respective super-duper powers.,2/4
2488,Aliens in the Attic,I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone over the age of fifteen who isn't trying to relive their youth from the 1980s.,3/5
2489,Aliens of the Deep,"Like many IMAX films, it's worth a look for the razzle-dazzle photography, but don't expect much in the way of serious science.",3/5
2490,Alila,Another piece of essential viewing for outsiders trying to understand life in the Middle East.,A-
2491,Ali's Wedding,I don't know why the release of this lovely film has been delayed so long (I saw it in Adelaide in October last year) but it's worth the wait.,4/5
2492,Alita: Battle Angel,I am so tired of a movie coming out that is about the seven other movies that they're going to make after this movie.,4.5/10
2493,Alive Inside,It's difficult to carefully consider Alive Inside: A Story of Music & Memorywhen it feels like a sappy high school video project.,2/4
2494,Aliyah,"A character piece should have some sense of a character's who, what and why, right?",2/5
2495,All In: The Poker Movie,"An achingly comprehensive poker-praising documentary that unfolds in rather scattershot form, yet still remains more or less entertaining enough to engage non-players.",3/5
2496,All About Lily Chou-Chou,"She's all-powerful, a voice for a pop-cyber culture that feeds on her Bjorkness.",3/4
2497,All About My Mother (Todo sobre mi madre),Incredibly interesting film to watch.,3.5/5
2498,All About Steve,"The results aren't quite Anchorman, but they're worth a chuckle.",2/5
2499,All About the Benjamins,The lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma. We don't even like their characters.,2/5
2500,All Cheerleaders Die,"There's plenty to enjoy - smart one-liners, nifty shocks and one truly unsettling confrontation in a cemetery - but nothing to give Joss Whedon a run for his money",3/5

2502,All Dogs Go To Heaven,"Technicolor is back with an improved color system, and in All Dogs Go to Heaven it permits such a voluptuous use of color that the movie is an invigorating bath for the eyes.",3/4
2503,All Dogs Go To Heaven 2,This dark coming-of-age story is a unique romp.,4/5
2504,All Eyez on Me,"Even hard line fans prepared to concede that 'Pac is too complex and contradictory a figure to ever be truly captured on-screen will be shocked by how far this poorly scripted, dreadfully directed affair misses the mark of the man.",1/5

2506,All Good Things,"A slow, melancholy tale of murder of how it pays to be rich if you want to get away with it.",B
2507,All I Can Say,"Both elegy and unintentional suicide note, the film is one of the most devastating archival collages playing this year's Tribeca festival.",8/10
2508,All I See Is You,"Even as All I See Is You descends into soapy nonsense, it remains visually engaging.",3/5
2509,Strike!,"Any film as energetically performed, entertaining, and rousing... clearly has the potential to cross the demographic barriers--that is, if given the chance.",3/4
2510,All I Want (Try Seventeen),"The story is ultimately stillborn, failing to generate much sympathy as a coming-of-age tale",2/5
2511,All I Wish (A Little Something for Your Birthday),"Derivative, confusing, and largely pointless.",C
2512,All Is Bright,"The film remains engaging, for the most part, but most of the big narrative turns feel both predictable and forced, and at odds with the natural charms of the cast.",2/4
2513,All Is Lost,"From bow to stern, Chandor delivers pure cinema.",9.1/10
2514,All Is True,"Slowly, as the thematic center of the film begins to take shape, so does Branagh's character - and in those moments the audience is treated to what amounts to nothing short of a Christmas gift for any Anglophile or Shakespeare lover.",B
2515,All Is Well (Alles ist gut),Trobisch lets the normality bite.,4/5
2516,All Mistakes Buried,"If there were Oscars for Best Performance in a Movie Academy Voters Wouldn't be Caught Dead Watching, Trammel's performance would be a lock for a nomination.",3/4
2517,All Nighter,"No, the main duo isn't the problem as much as it is the bad writing and a lot of the cast around them.",1.5/5
2518,All Over the Guy,Forgets to iron out the kinks that make the straight romantic comedies feel like tediously long television sitcoms.,2/4
2519,All Relative,Introduces one far-fetched idea and then frustratingly refuses to expand on it. The premise suffocates the movie.,1.5/4
2520,All Roads Lead Home,All Roads Lead Home is more hackneyed than it is heartwarming. It's considerably more annoying than it is enjoyable.,1.5/4
2521,All Roads Lead to Rome,Lackluster mother-daughter comedy has teen drug use.,2/5
2522,All Saints,"In the genre of faith-based films, Gomer's effort does a good job of being candid about its faith without becoming preachy and serves as an appealing illustration of the principles it espouses.",3.5/4
2523,All Square,"Kelly offers a breezy and conversational voiceover that sounds a lot like a guy sitting next to you at a bar who wants you to buy into his Ponzi scheme. The more cynical viewer may be wary, yet all still enjoy hearing the prattle.",4/5
2524,All Stars,"Some day, God willing, there will be a moratorium on films about plucky kids putting on talent shows to save their schools/parks/yoof centres from predatory developers.",1/5
2525,All Summers End,"Not merely a small film, but one with significant script problems, including a tendency to sermonize. It does, however, offer the opportunity to watch some fine young actors do excellent work.",C+
2526,All That Heaven Allows,"imbued with a deep intelligence, wit, and critical outlook that emerges if you view it in a certain way, but is not so obvious that it ruptures the clean, slick surface",4/4
2527,All the Bright Places,Schmaltzy...a moon-eyed teen romance that doesn't know when to drop the mike.,1.5/4
2528,All the Devil's Men,All The Devil's Men is a brawny Michael Mann-style thriller from writer-director Matthew Hope.,3.5/5
2529,All The King's Men,"Unlikely to win any Best Picture nominations, though don't be surprised of Sean Penn gets considered for another Oscar.",2.5/5
2530,All the Little Animals,Interesting despite its hipster crypticism and an imperfect finale. Is Christian Bale in every film Lions Gate has made?,3.5/5

2533,All the Pretty Horses,Misses the mark as a classic drama about coming of age....what we see on the screen is curiously devoid of soul.,1/5
2534,All the Queen's Men,A crass and insulting homage to great films like Some Like It Hot and the John Wayne classics.,1.5/5
2535,All the Real Girls,"Rather than tying together into a satisfying whole, the fragments seem to fly off in any number of directions, and a sweet, simple tale of young love dissolves into a mishmash.",2.5/5
2536,All the Right Moves,"All the Right Moves is a low-key, well-acted and beautifully photographed slice-of-life ""people"" story.",77/100
2537,All the Way,"Complexity flows from Cranston. He can't replicate LBJ's girth or age, but his ferocious performance -- aided by seamless makeup and helmer Jay Roach's framing -- is fully convincing.",B
2538,All These Small Moments,"Despite being overly tidy and commonplace in its plot, [director Melissa B.] Miller-Costanzo succeeds in deliberately avoiding resolution, and while that's bound to frustrate people, it's key to the movie's payoff.",B
2539,All Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,"While the yellow and red sign may be gone, perhaps the lasting legacy of Tower is that in their customers they bred a generation of curious and enthusiastic listeners who continue to follow the music, no matter where it comes from next.",B
2540,All Things To All Men,It's not often you find a crime thriller that doubles as a tourist information video.,3/5
2541,"All This, and Heaven Too","Anatole Litvak directs with tact and restraint this period melodrama (a woman's picture) about a governess who falls for her employer-nobleman. Davis and Boyer are good, but it's Barbara O'Neil who stands out as Boyer's neurotic and obsessive wife.",B

2550,Almost an Angel,"I cannot, however, much as I'd like to, quite recommend this movie -- the going gets a little thick at the end, and some of the plot developments are dumb... But that isn't to say I'm scornful of the film's special qualities and its gentle good humor.",2.5/4
2551,Almost Christmas,"Christmas film comfort food, packed with cliches but an amusing antidote to the most toxic fall in recent American history",2.5/4

2553,Almost Friends,A romance that almost comes off,2/4
2554,Almost Heroes,This is a dreadful motion picture -- a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio.,1/4
2555,Almost Human,The degree to which Almost Human ultimately peters out is rather distressing (to put it mildly)...,2/4
2556,Almost Love,"Energetic yet angsty, Sell By offers a viewer experience a bit like babysitting a six-year-old -- charming in places, certainly funny, but also exhausting and liable to try one's patience.",3/5

2558,Aloft,"Aloft is a meditative, thoughtful film, that wants to glide like a hawk into the sky and inspire us to wonder, but its narrative has feet of clay that all the wispy winsomeness cannot conceal.",C+

2565,Along Came a Spider,There are just too many holes in the plotline of this hollow thriller for it to be convincing.,C

2767,Animal Farm,as interesting on screen as it is behind the veil,3.5/5
2768,Animal Kingdom,"This could have been a slick little thriller. Instead, it evolves into the unfolding of an epic tragedy.",4.5/5
2769,Animals,It is a character study that reminds me of the first time I saw Gus Van Sant's Drugstore Cowboy. And it could eventually herald the arrival of as important a talent.,4/5
2770,Animals United (Konferenz der Tiere),If you kitted Al Gore out in a furry animal costume and put him on a soapbox you'd have a rough idea of the environmental message trumpeted in this harmless kids' fare.,3/5

2775,Anna and the King of Siam,"Rex Harrison is sexy, Irene Dunne is prim, but the racism is evident.",3/5
2776,Anna Karenina,"Rather than involve us in the story Wright's grandiose concept keeps it at arm's length, forever highlighting the smoke, mirrors and meticulous stage management that have been pressed into service to make his big idea a reality.",2/5
2777,Annabelle,"Annabelle drifts away from these potentially interesting elements into a more predictable collage of frights, demons and flickering lights, a grab bag of set pieces, red herrings and familiar occult tropes that never add up to much.",2.5/5
2778,Annabelle Comes Home,it's time to give Annabelle a rest and finally move on to The Conjuring 3 or whatever of the 30 demons here becomes an Internet phenomenon and gets greenlit for its own movie,2/5
2779,Annabelle: Creation,"Annabelle: Creation is the rare horror sequel that improves upon the original, featuring more engaging protagonists and a far less problematic ending.",7/10
2780,Annapolis,"If the powers behind this pasteboard mockup of a film wanted to remake AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN, why didn't they just go ahead and do that? . . . [I]f they wanted to remake ROCKY, why didn't they just go ahead and do that?",1/5

2782,Anne of the Thousand Days,"One of those almost unbearably classy movies, like A Man for All Seasons and Becket, that have a way of elevating the reputations of moviemakers without doing much for the art.",2.5/5
2783,Annie,...the film version of the stage hit is an old-fashioned charmer.,7/10
2784,Annie,"It's going to be a hard knock holiday for the parents. Wallis aside, Annie is a noxious mess that represents family ""entertainment"" at its most insufferable.",3/10

2787,The Anniversary Party,A striking triumph!,3.5/4
2788,Anomalisa,"The delightfully downcast and sometimes masterful ""Anomalisa"" proves there is more than one way to skin a similar cat, and the unbearable darkness of being can still radiate glimmers of beauty.",B+

2797,Another Gay Sequel: Gays Gone Wild!,"Includes clever references to the straight raunchfests Porky's and American Pie. But his film feels more like a collection of skits than a cohesive story. His characters aren't even half-dimensional and, except for Nico, are boorish bores.",1.5/4
2798,Another Happy Day,A movie that will make you laugh and cry in equal proportions and it signals the arrival of another terrific second generation filmmaker.,9/10
2799,Another Stakeout,Plays more like National Lampoon's Seattle Vacation than a sly comedy/drama about undercover cops.,1.5/4
2800,Another Thin Man,Third entry in the series is nearly up to the second.,4/5
2801,Another WolfCop,"There isn't one single moment in the film that is meant to be taken seriously. If that's your idea of cinematic fun, howl along.",1.5/4

2803,Another Year,This touching and beautifully nuanced drama from England's master of cinematic improvisation,4/5
2804,Another You,Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor have been a brilliant team in the past. Such is so plainly not the case in this awful little misfire.,1/5

2807,The Ant Bully,"This uneven high-concept animation begs for ideological comparison with the superior Antz, also set in ants colony. If in 1998 Woody Allen fought for freedom and non-conformity, this hero gets civic lessons about togetherness and collective welfare.",B-
2808,Ant-Man and the Wasp,"Ant-Man and the Wasp is a nice lighthearted breather from recent devastating MCU events; this isn't the first time Ant-Man has had a tough act to follow, and judging from this sequel, it won't be the last, as the successful levity is welcome",3/5

2810,Antarctica: Ice & Sky (La glace et le ciel),"If there's a lesson to be learned from Ice and the Sky - beyond the obvious perils of ignoring the signs of climate change - it's of the importance of the research, drilling and testing that are behind the conclusions on offer.",4/5
2811,Antboy,"You gotta love a movie that calls itself ""Antboy."" Unless, alas, you also have to sit through this Danish, dubbed-in-English kiddie movie.",2/4

2814,Anthropoid,"If Ellis and co-screenwriter Anthony Frewin's attention to historical detail hinders Anthropoid initially, it breathes life into ... an action packed ... second half.",B
2815,Anti Matter,"Despite its daft premise, Anti Matter offers a cerebral and intelligent take on what is a genre perennial: something going amiss in a newly-developed matter transporter.",8/10
2816,Antibirth,"Antibirth feels more like an anti-film, a piss-poor assembly of remarkable cult actors and brazen narratives that start off divorced without ever being married. What a disappointing, irrelevant misfire.",D
2817,Antiquities,"A smartly observed film with a sweet centre, Antiquities takes old themes and polishes them up until they shine.",3.5/5
2818,Antisocial,"This unconvincing techno-horror is too self-serious to be entertaining, but also too silly to be taken seriously.",2/5
2819,Antitrust,"A film geared for those who can't get enough of geek angst, PC's, and cappuccino into their system...",C
2820,Antiviral,"For Cronenberg fans, the prodigal son's debut will be a revivalist bodyshock gem, and for everyone else, it'll seem more than a little weird.",B+

2824,Antonio Gaudí,The film is a visual rhapsody enhanced with music and sound effects created by the renowned Japanese film composer Toru Takemitsu and two collaborators.,4/5
2825,Antrum: The Deadliest Film Ever Made,"Anyone who has a fondness for seventies grindhouse or even arthouse obscurities will find something to enjoy here, such is the attention to detail. Everything about the film-within-a-film appears authentic",8/10
2826,Ants on a Shrimp,It offers lively and layered images that reveal the chefs both as individuals and components of a larger social organism.,3/4
2827,Antwone Fisher,The life of Antwone Fisher may indeed be one that cries out for a movie treatment but you wouldn't know it from this tepid bio.,2/5
2828,Antz,"Thank goodness the seven-year-old in the theater seats won't have a clue about the dialogue. What would happen if they gave Z a chance and refused to comply with everything their mommies and daddies want them (for their own good, of course) to do?",8/10
2829,Anvil! The Story of Anvil,"Funny, sweet and often interesting... but the desperation is so tangible it proves exhausting",B-

2838,Anywhere but Here,A sappy soap opera-style drama with absolutely no necessity to develop believability.,1.5/4
2839,Anzio (Lo sbarco di Anzio),"Anzio is unusual in its ability to make the military strategy clear and interesting; instead of anonymous men wandering around chaotically, we get a coherent picture of the campaign's successes and failures.",3/4
2840,Apache,"... not a total success, but overcomes its leaden storytelling by being muscular and accepting of the Apache culture without being patronizing.",B

2846,Apollo 11,A remarkable cinematic experience that is breathtaking to witness and redefines the medium of documentary filmmaking.,5/5
2847,Apollo 13,"It chronicles one of the most dramatic of all spaceflights, an American catastrophe that became an American victory, and it does this in a way that's so authentic, so brilliant in its technical details, that it succeeds in putting us on that ship.",B

2849,The Apostle,"Walking away from The Apostle, I felt renewed and reborn...",4/4

2852,The Apple Dumpling Gang,"Everytime I see one of these antiseptic Disney films, I'm reminded of the thrills and genuine artistry that went into the studio's films during its golden age in the 1940s and 1950s.",2.5/4
2853,Applesauce,"Tukel invests most of his narrative making terrible people objects of ridicule, with a final punchline suggesting that, in the game of life, everyone's stuck on one side or the other of the same bad joke.",B
2854,The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,An alternately sad and hilarious movie of dreams rampant.,4/5
2855,Approaching the Unknown,"Well-acted ""The Martian"" on a budget, without the suspense, originality or smarts to compete with that film.",2/4
2856,Appropriate Behavior,"Funny, unique, and entirely inappropriate, Appropriate Behavior is a supremely satisfying and irreverent take on the New York rom-com.",B+
2857,Après vous (After You),"While it basically reuses all of the conventions of a typical French romantic farce, it does so with winning aplomb.",4/5
2858,April and the Extraordinary World (Avril et le monde truqué),It provocatively has audiences see the world's current ecological concerns in a different and unexpected light.,3/4

2860,Apt Pupil,Major junk!,1/4

2862,Aquamarine,"The story, based on Alice Hoffman's YA novel, nicely blends the fantasy elements with astutely observed portrayals of early-teen fears and friendships. That's where the real magic is.",B+
2863,Aquaslash,This summertime bummer can't even live up to water-park-horror classics such as [checks notes] Piranha 3DD.,1.5/5
2864,Aquellos que me Aman Tomarán el Tren,"There's little substance to the dialogue or the plotless narrative, but the intense actors seem to put everything into their performance and give it an air that something big is taking place.",C
2865,Arabian Nights,Pasolini's Arabian Nights succeeds mostly because it never assumes neither frank carnality nor flights of fancy are beneath us.,3.5/4
2866,Arachnophobia,"It gives you the willies in a cheery, presentable way.",B+

2873,Arctic Tale,"Children and Republicans may benefit from its message, but Arctic Tale isn't to be trusted, though not for any reason having to do with its thoughts on climate change.",2/4
2874,Are We Done Yet?,"What makes Are We Done Yet? so shoddy isn't its likeable star's now-familiar cuddly-bear persona, but the fact that the film could easily pass for another entry in the Cheaper by the Dozen franchise.",1.5/4
2875,Are You Here,"You Are Here is a shockingly inept comedy, a project with the look and style of a mid-'90s Ivan Reitman or Harold Ramis comedy, not the first film from one of our finest TV writers.",D
2876,Argo,"An intelligent, expertly-made thriller with glimmers of the extraordinary.",B
2877,Aria,"I am not sure that any indispensable statement about opera has been made here, and purists will no doubt recoil by the irreverence of some of the images. But the film is fun almost as a satire of itself.",3/4

2889,Armored,"It's a film without twists, where everything is what it seems, and when the mess has been resolved, it's even at a loss for a proper denouement. Armored just ends-and with it, so does the access to +h chairs and free air conditioning.",C-

2957,At Eternity's Gate,"It boats a remarkably rich and sensitive portrayal of the artist from Willem Dafoe but, as a piece of drama, it is torpid in the extreme.",2/5
2958,At First Light,"Try as I might, I just wasn't all that invested in the fate of Alex and Sean or their own private close encounter with the third kind. Which is a shame as the filmmaker shows a keen flair for an interesting visual and aural palette.",2/5
2959,At Middleton,Pleasant but irksome to a fault. Why should the viewer care about these characters when they don't seem to care about anyone but themselves?,2/4

2965,Atlantics,"As it ventures further along its spellbinding path, ""Atlantics"" remains a deeply romantic work that magnetized the fears of people trapped by their surroundings and striving for the companionship that can rescue them from despair.",B+
2966,Atlantis - The Lost Empire,This is one effort that lacks that fabled Disney magical touch.,2/4
2967,Atlas Shrugged: Part I,"Look, the problem with adapting Atlas Shrugged in the first place is that it's just not a great story.",2/10

3053,Babylon A.D.,"Although based on Maurice George Dantec's sci-fi novel ""Babylon Babies"" ""Babylon A.D."" comes across as an undercooked retooling of Alfonso Cuaron's much better 2006 film ""Children of Men."" Even the most forgiving sci-fi fans will have a hard time making s",C-

3141,Band of Angels,"...an outdated, relentlessly irrelevant piece of work.",1/4
3142,Band Of Robbers,"Quirky, cunning, and even a little heartwarming, this is a perfect example of taking a classic story and offering it to a brand new audience.",9/10
3143,Band of the Hand,It's the closest any film of the era comes to predicting the mission-based Miami world of the recent video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.,3.5/5

3145,B&B,"An edgy, topical thriller with a blackly comical undertone, this offbeat little British film takes some startling twists and turns as its plot unfolds. It's tightly contained.",3.5/5

3155,B.A.P.S.,Robert Townsend's career continues its ongoing descent with this ludicrously awful culture-clash comedy.,0/5
3156,Barabbas,"Lacking the Circus Maximus spectacle of its famous predecessor, Barabbas compensates with nuanced acting from Anthony Quinn",B
3157,Baraka,"Sweeping, jarring and mesmerizing -- not to mention mind-blowing, if I may indulge a '60s phrase.",3.5/4
3158,Baran,"Baran is shockingly devoid of your typical Majid Majidi shoe-loving, crippled children.",3/4
3159,Barb Wire,"It is, after all, a comic book come to life (it's based on the Dark Horse comic series) and doesn't pretend to be about anything more than that.",2.5/4
3160,Barbara,"Most compelling in Barbara, Christian Petzold's latest, is the way the filmmaker adeptly conducts his tides of Cold War paranoia.",3/4
3161,Barbara Rubin & the Exploding NY Underground,A worthy introduction to a lesser known filmmaker. Well-edited and illuminating. A must-see for film buffs.,8.25/10

3167,Barbershop: The Next Cut,"Even though it touches upon topical issues, its drama is forced and hinders rather than compliments proceedings.",2.5/5

3173,Barfi!,"Against your will, you may even shed a tear.",3/5
3174,Barfly,"The result is a truly original American movie, a film like no other, a period of time spent in the company of the kinds of characters Saroyan and O'Neill would have understood.",4/4
3175,Bark!,The result is amusing human interaction while the film ponders what it means to be mentally ill and challenges how society deals with those who are.,3/5
3176,Barking Dogs Never Bite (Flandersui gae),"Barking Dogs Never Bite is uneven, unnecessarily provocative, and exhausts its central premise long before the closing credits, but it's invigorating to watch regardless.",B+
3177,Barking Water,"Harjo poeticizes the open road with increasing redundancy, yet his identical scenic panoramas remain preferable to his dramaturgy, which mistakes silence for pensiveness.",1.5/4
3178,The Barkleys of Broadway,"It's Fred and Ginger and in color, but the movie's pretty bad.",3/5
3179,Barney's Version,"It's an entirely serviceable adaptation, even if it sacrifices the complexity of Richler's novel (and the subtleties of Giamatti's performance) in order to cram as many characters and incidents its two-+ hours.",3/5
3180,Barney's Great Adventure,Surprisingly bearable.,B-
3181,Barnyard,... feels like Barnyard swipes too much of its plot from The Lion King.,C+
3182,The Barretts of Wimpole Street,"When not even Charles Laughton, playing a deranged, scarily pious, and pretty obviously incestuous domineering father can save a film, you know you have problems.",2/5
3183,Barry,"The result is a decent picture, if one that leans pretty heavily on the future resonance of every interaction and conversation.",3/5
3184,Barry Lyndon,"Beneath the period piece, Merchant Ivory, Ryan O'Neal-miscast surface of the film lies a poetic little allegory, as complex and involving as his other work.",4/4
3185,Barry Munday,Manages to be both funny and touching when it doesn't seem capable of either.,3/5
3186,Barrymore,"Effortless charm has always been a characteristic of Plummer's performance, and here he wields it to considerable effect.",2.5/4
3187,Bart Got a Room,"It's sort of ironic that the only demographic that'll appreciate this lame, watered-down brand of humor mirrors the community portrayed in the film: the elderly and infirm",2/5
3188,Bartleby,"From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast, Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out.",2.5/5
3189,Barton Fink,"Certainly not for everyone, but if you're looking for something different, something outrageously fascinating, something daring and open-ended, this is it.",3.5/4

3191,Basic,Connie Nielsen has an inconsistent southern accent that will grate on your nerves.,C
3192,Basic Instinct,"Basic Instinct was a seminal 1990s film, but like a lot of things from the 1990s, it hasn't aged very well.",2.5/4
3193,Basic Instinct 2,"The 14-year-behind-the-scenes story of making this sequel is far more interesting than anything that's onscreen, including Sharon Stone's nudity and sex in a rooftop jacuzzi.",1/4

3201,The Bat Whispers,The Bat Whispers is a talkie remake of Roland West's silent 1926 version.,C
3202,Bathtubs Over Broadway,"The fun of ""Bathtubs Over Broadway"" is in learning the reach of these productions. It seems thousands of companies - large and small - produced them to present to their executives and sales staffs at annual regional and national gatherings.",3.5/4
3203,Batkid Begins,Batkid Begins is almost better than Xanax. It's like swallowing a little yellow happy pill with the Bat signal on it.,B
3204,Batman and Harley Quinn,"Make no mistake, this is a gorgeously rendered tribute to Batman: The Animated Series and the voice cast was top notch. But Batman and Harley Quinn just doesn't stand up to the best episodes of that show.",7.9/10

3206,Batman: Assault on Arkham,"The title says ""Batman"" and his face takes up most of the box art, but this is less an adaptation of the Batman/Arkham video games than a straight-up Suicide Squad movie.",7/10
3207,Batman: Bad Blood,"So much is made of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but what DC is doing with these animated features is much more organic.",3/4
3208,Batman Begins,"The ne + ultra of comic-book films...an appropriately tough movie, busy but efficient, rich and thoughtful, and ornamented with visual appeal and exciting action.",4/4

3210,Batman Forever,I was bored from the beginning.,1/4
3211,Batman: Gotham by Gaslight,"In Batman: Gotham By Gaslight, the world is well-constructed and there are some standout performances, but the story at its core isn't as strong as it ought to be.",6.5/10
3212,Batman Gotham Knight,would've been bloody marvelous had two-thirds of the animated anthology segments not stunk,2.5/5
3213,Batman: Hush,"Batman gets hot and heavy with Catwoman in an action-packed, intriguing mystery. Batman: Hush is a stellar entry in the DC Animated Universe.",3.5/5
3214,Batman: Mask of the Phantasm,"Sadly, it seems more care was taken with the jazzy ad campaign than with the movie itself.",2/4
3215,Batman Ninja,"Batman Ninja takes everything great about the masked vigilante and twists it in a way we've never seen, creating a visual marvel unlike any other Batman animated movie before it.",9.7/10
3216,Batman: Return Of The Caped Crusaders,"Oh Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders, what have you done? You were supposed to be a kitschy throwback to 50 years ago, a gleeful POW! in the face of a brooding Batfleck, but you're so much more.",4/5
3217,Batman Returns,The last great Batman.,4/5
3218,The Batman Superman Movie: World's Finest,"Although the look of The Batman Superman Movie works, the simple and unenthusiastic story hinders the overall presentation.",67/100
3219,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1","It's highly respectful of the work on which it is based, yet also a solidly entertaining effort in its own right.",3.5/4
3220,Batman: The Killing Joke,"The confrontation between the comic world's ultimate hero and villain is well worth the wait, though first there's the Dark Knight's mentoring of the young Batgirl to get through.",3/5
3221,Batman: The Movie,Dreadful unwatchable movie version of the campy Batman television series popular in the 1960s.,0/4
3222,Batman: Under the Red Hood,"With its colorful, exciting action and well-defined emotional underpinnings, Batman: Under the Red Hood is the best yet in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line. [Blu-ray]",3.5/4
3223,Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,"When it sings, Dawn of Justice is a wonder. When it drags, it still looks good and offers hints of a better scene just around the corner.",3/4
3224,Batman Vs. Robin,"Bolstered by a compelling story that features one of the most intriguing elements in Batman mythology, the film ranks among the best in the series so far.",3.5/4
3225,Batman vs Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"A stylized, PG-13 extravaganza that's peppered with enjoyable characters and major showdowns, giving fans the breezy, bruising sit they've been waiting for.",B+
3226,Batman vs. Two-Face,"William Shatner's Two-Face/Harvey Dent is nicely realized and fits in well with this particular take on the Batman world, while Adam West brings his affable charm and unassailable good humor to his iconic take on the character one last time.",8.4/10
3227,Batman: Year One,"Marital infidelity, child prostitution and civic corruption are bluntly (although tastefully) displayed - it just so happens that there's also a guy zipping around town in a bat suit.",A-

3229,*batteries not included,Aliens help the poor!,3/5
3230,Battle: Los Angeles,"The weak link is Christopher Bertolini's script, which lumbers the flat military characters with hackneyed dialogue and corny sentimentality. Not even Eckhart can survive such banality, and kick-ass specialist Michelle Rodriguez is wasted.",2/5

3236,Battle For The Planet Of The Apes,"With the budgets decreasing, creative ideas waning, and costumes and makeup getting more worn-out, it's a good thing that this is the final sequel.",D

3238,Battle of Britain,Surprisingly flat considering the talent involved.,3/5
3239,The Battle of Shaker Heights,"LaBeouf shines when it counts, and his quirky appeal, as he tries to get the girl (Amy Smart), makes him worth rooting for.",B-
3240,Battle of the Bulge,"Precise, compelling tale of one of WWII's biggest battles.",4/5
3241,Battle of the Sexes,"""Battle Of The Sexes"" might not be a grand slam final, but it's certainly worth the cost of seeing a match in person.",B
3242,Battle of the Year,"Remarkably, the highlight of Benson Lee's film, essentially a fiction reboot of his Planet B-Boy, isn't the scene where Chris Brown gets punched in the face.",1.5/4

3245,Battlefield America,"Mmmm-hmmm, it's on. Again.",C
3246,Battlefield Earth,"The leader bares a resemblance to Andy Rooney of 60 Minutes, eyebrows and all. It would have been apropos for him to look into the camera and say, 'Don't you just hate it when you waste money on really stupid movies with cheesy special effects?'",0.5/4
3247,Battleship,... the result is a wannabe-blockbuster that should be studied in film schools as a perfect example of what happens when commerce becomes more important than concept.,C-
3248,Battleship Potemkin,"If you are at all interested in the history of cinema, or the influence of 20th century politics on the medium, then this film is a must-see, although over an hour of Soviet propaganda is likely to test the patience of modern viewers.",5/5
3249,Battlestar Galactica,The plot is as old as it gets and merely serves to get a group of people aimlessly lost in space.,2/4
3250,Battling Butler,"Below par, at least for the unrivaled master of silent comedy.",3/5
3251,Bayou Maharajah,"...despite the title of the doc, which conjures up a madcap, heartbreaking tale, the film is a mostly workmanlike biopic that unfortunately can never match the energy of the subject it's trying to capture",C+
3252,Baywatch,"It's eerily similar to the TV show, but not strictly in content or execution... No, what the film-makers have captured and emulated is the TV show's trademark combination of conspicuous sleaze and formal naivety.",1/5
3253,BB King: The Life of Riley,"In the music business, 'legend' is an over-used word: see this and understand what it means.",4/5
3254,Be Afraid,"Somewhat tasteless and easily overwhelmed, but the fact that it isn't scary is the real disappointment.",D

3257,Be Kind Rewind,"One of Gondry's weakest films, this one-note comedy is a short stretched to the limits of a feature-length movie that even pros like Jack Black can't rescue.",C
3258,Be My Cat: A Film for Anne,"This Romanian found-footage film may hold few surprises and drags through much of its run time, but it's worth checking out for the filmmaker's seriously deranged performance...suggests ""Angst"" by way of ""My Date with Drew.""",C+
3259,Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché,"In her passionate debut film, Green achieves a feat of making a two-level research project informative and entertaining. Exciting and essential documentary for film history!",10/10
3260,Be With Me,"A delicately crafted, gently inflected, lovely little movie about the need for love.",3/4

3264,Beach Rats,Beach Rats is a captivating character study and one that feels vital.,4/5
3265,Beaches,"Maybe the problem is with the flashbacks. Maybe if the whole story had simply been told from beginning to end, it would have felt less like one of those 1950s tearjerkers with the rain blowing in through the window and getting the curtains all wet.",2.5/4
3266,Bean,"At an hour, Bean would have been nonstop laughs. Then they added 30 minutes of stops.",2.5/4
3267,Beanpole (Dylda),"Extraordinary performances and ""Roma""-level production design elevate a brutal yet tender story of two women in post-war Leningrad.",B+

3271,Ching yan (The Beast Stalker),A movie that has all the best elements of a great Hong Kong action film: It's over the top and ingeniously plotted (even if that plot strains credibility) and never stops moving.,4/4
3272,The Beast Within,Gruesome gore is the sole highlight.,1/5

3281,Beats,"Beats is entertaining enough, but like many Netflix offerings can feel inconsequential.",3/5
3282,Beats Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest,Starts out rather conventionally and builds into one of the most engaging music docs in years.,3.5/5
3283,Beau Geste,"Beau Geste (1939) is director/producer William Wellman's superb, high adventure tale set in the desert - a classic melodramatic, rousing film of the late 30s from Paramount Studios. The film was originally to be directed by Henry Hathaway...",A
3284,The Beautician and the Beast,Listening to Fran Drescher's nasal squawk for an entire movie is the price you'll pay to see The Beautician and the Beast. Imagine having your ear canal scoured with Brillo. Only more abrasive.,2/4

3303,Beauty and the Beast,"Beauty and the Beast is simply a cover version of a chart-topping song, played with such anonymous competence that Condon's motto must have been, ""It ain't broke, don't fix it."" Another motto might have been better: ""If it ain't broke, don't remake it.""",2/5

3331,Beer Wars,"This soapbox doc ain't a promo for the suds you swig while watching ESPN! Filmmaker Anat Baron's Beer Wars asserts that best-selling brews like Budweiser, Miller's and Coors are more like colored water.",3.5/5
3332,Beerfest,"This ode to the mass consumption of tasty brews is out of bubbles. Drink up before you see it, you'll need the buzz.",2.5/5
3333,Beeswax,"[A] quiet backyard-story from the reluctant figurehead of mumblecore, Andrew Bujalski.",4/5
3334,Beethoven's 2nd,"This movie has one clear reason for being: The success of the original ""Beethoven,"" which grossed something like $70 million.",2/4
3335,Beethoven's 3rd,"From a dramatic standpoint, there is not even the level of emotional depth achieved by the second Beethoven film, but as basic and unimaginative as the slapstick often is, it delivers to its target audience.",1/5
3336,Beethoven's 4th,An unoriginal but sometimes funny family film,2/4
3337,Beetle Queen Conquers Tokyo,"This densely structured film is concerned with the interplay between a Zen-based traditional way of life and the alienating demands of urban modernity, a questionable dichotomy it has predictable difficulty resolving.",2.5/4
3338,Beetlejuice,"Burton makes good use of all the possibilities offered by the plot and gives us some wildly original creatures, most notably Michael Keaton as the terrible Beetlejuice.",3/4
3339,Before I Disappear,Before I Disappear shows a lot of promise for the cast and actor/writer/director Christensen.,4/5
3340,Before I Fall,"""Will make its core audience of teenage girls melt and is a nice diversion for everyone else.""",B-
3341,Before I Go to Sleep,"Roland Joff has constructed a briskly paced, devilishly clever cat-and-mouse game, with a shivery atmosphere and an impressively tight focus.",3/5
3342,Before Midnight,"Admirers of the first two films will feel pangs of nostalgia and a residual warmth for its charismatic leads, but as an extension to the series it feels forced and unnecessary.",2/5
3343,Before Night Falls,Convincingly shows how freedom is the air that writers must breathe in order to fully express their creative souls.,4/5
3344,Before Stonewall,"Before Stonewall stands as a competent documentary, straight-forward without any great cinematic techniques that stand out",B-
3345,Before Sunrise,Before Sunrise is so much like real life -- like a documentary with an invisible camera -- that I found myself remembering real conversations I had experienced with more or less the same words.,3/4
3346,Before Sunset,The splendid sequel to an overlooked gem.,4.5/5
3347,Before the Devil Knows You're Dead,A crime drama on par with classics like the Coens' Fargo with intense drama in the vein of Todd Field's In the Bedroom.,9/10
3348,Before the Flood,"Before the Flood isn't simply interested in showing how terrible everything is. It also does a fantastic job of highlighting solutions for climate change, both short-term and long-term.",4/5
3349,Before We Go,"If there is anything Chris Evans can take away from ""Before We Go,"" it would be to treat the film as a tremendous learning experience. Making a good film requires more than simply aping the structure and superficial qualities of better movies.",D

3351,Begin Again,"A lovely story that's sweet, funny and heartfelt -- and man does it sound good.",3/5
3352,Beginners,...the pervasively uneven atmosphere is essentially heightened by the ongoing emphasis on off-the-wall elements.,2.5/4
3353,The Beguiled,Provocative and hypnotic...Eastwood revels with spellbinding spunk in this suggestive military melodrama,4/5
3354,Behaving Badly,"Rick's ultimate journey becomes less about atonement than simply getting the girl, and moral reclamation reveals itself as the vehicle by which to peddle a bunch of people behaving badly.",2/4
3355,Behind Enemy Lines II: Axis of Evil,"Will offer a mild diversion to the action aficionadoes, but even those who like the flick will probably erase it from their memory banks in less than a week.",2.5/5
3356,Behind The Burly Q,A worthwhile trip down burlesque lane with the usual documentary bumps: too many talking heads at the expense of archival footage.,B-
3357,Behind the Candelabra,"The lifestyles of the rich, famous and queer get a provocative examination in Steven Soderbergh's 'Behind the Candelabra.'",7
3358,Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon,"If you've grown up on the unending exploits of the 80s cinematic stalkers, you'll find a lot to enjoy here.",4/5
3359,Behind You,"With a tiresomely reworked script, wooden performances and cliched tropes, it's a film which relies solely on some infrequent but inspired visuals considering its limited scope and budget.",1.5/5
3360,Behold a Pale Horse,...elevated by some expectedly great acting.,3/4
3361,Beijing Taxi,An attractive and seamless set of images of working-class Chinese life.,4/5
3362,Being 17 (Quand on a 17 ans),A cruel and ironic reflection of what future will bring for youth. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
3363,Being at home with Claude,"The movie tries to make Yves' decision into some kind of deep metaphysical statement, but actually it's just a tortured version of the old advice to live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse.",1/4
3364,Being Elmo: A Puppeteer's Journey,"I've actually never been a huge fan of the Elmo character, but this very charming film has made me a fan of Clash.",4/5
3365,Being Evel,"A wild, wooly strut through a period in American history when the country rallied around a man who would probably, at the end of the broadcast, be lying unconscious at the end of the runway, ready to get up and do it again the very next night.",B+
3366,Being Flynn,There is absolute brilliance at work here both in the way Weitz tells Nick Flynn's story and how he gets such fantastic performances out of De Niro and Dano.,8/10
3367,Being Frank,"With its mix of comedy and drama, Being Frank delivers the goods in filmmaker Miranda Bailey's narrative feature directorial debut.",4/5
3368,Being Human,"Just when you think the parts are never going to connect, they do so quite movingly",3/5
3369,Being John Malkovich,Destined for well-deserved cult status along side such creepy-comedy masterpieces as Brazil and Harold and Maude.,4/4
3370,Being Julia,"Though Being Julia is an undeniably lush and expensive-looking production, the film never manages to step beyond the realm of over-the-top campiness.",2/4
3371,Being There,"The overall tone is one of light drama, and it's only through its situations that it becomes a sly, witty statement on society, politics and pop culture.",4.5/5
3372,Beirut,"Beirut proves surprisingly sensitive in its handling of the Middle East, mapping out an area of nuanced power struggle rather than a cartoon Casablanca-style warzone.",4/5
3373,Bel Ami,A good-looking yet curiously tame adaptation of a saucy classic that showcases Pattinson's ambition if not his full abilities.,3/5
3374,Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla,Wow! Mesmerizingly bad with a nice late in the day turn from Lugosi,3/5
3375,Believe in Me,"Sincere, but insufferably dull.",2/4
3376,Believe,"Although the picture is ostensibly aimed at the Christian demographic, it has a complicated enough storyline, including a love triangle and intriguing plot twists, to appeal to more than merely Bible-thumping Evangelicals.",3/4
3377,Believe Me,"An almost-edgy faith-based dramedy, a not-quite-edgy Christian ""crusade"" satire, this never quite comes off as either.",2/4

3385,Belly,"All of Williams's glitz, delicious eye candy as it is, eventually overshadows his own script.",2/4
3386,Beloved,"Beloved veers too wildly into the 'bitter' and the 'sweet', never quite syncing up into a totally satisfying final product.",2.5/5
3387,Beloved Sisters,It blossoms into a breezily utopian depiction of a mnage  trois whose entirely matter-of-fact presentation sets up an intriguing dissonance with the prim period setting.,2.5/4
3388,Below,Twohy's scary tricks lose their luster around the time Below becomes a water-logged version of every haunted house film you've ever seen.,2/4
3389,Belzebuth,Emilio Portes presents a film about possessions and exorcisms that has narrative solvency and manages to associate the sinister about human behavior with the sinister of the paranormal. [Full Review in Spanish],3/5
3390,Ben,"One of the ""better"" rat attack flicks, if that's a worthwhile distinction.",3/5
3391,Ben-Hur,"A rousing, thrilling, and exhilarating epic in spite of the lethargic, stilted drama during its first hour. Morgan Freeman shows up as Ilderim to rescue both Ben-Hur and the film as well.",7.83/10
3392,Ben is Back,"Always underplayed, but never more than a millisecond from losing his grip, Hedges' performance exists in the narrow space between coming back for a day, and being gone forever.",B
3393,The Benchwarmers,"This is, for all its supposed charms, a very nasty little movie.",1/5
3394,Bend It Like Beckham,"The fact that it makes us consider implications beyond the events onscreen is impressive. Still, there's something missing...",3/4
3395,Benda Bilili!,"Take the Buena Vista Social Club, add some wheelchairs and you have Staff Benda Bilili...",4/5
3396,Beneath,Its stance toward every dipshit slasher and creature-horror flick that's come before it never feels less than casually hostile.,2/4
3397,Beneath Hill 60,"Beneath Hill 60 is a strong film telling an important story and while it won't have the same impact as Gallipoli, it is still a film of significance.",3.5/5
3398,Beneath The Darkness,Dennis Quaid tries to look villainous but he's no Jack Nicholson,C+
3399,Beneath The Harvest Sky,"...filmmakers Aron Gaudet and Gita Pullapilly offer up a central character, in the form of Cohen's Casper, that couldn't possibly be more unlikable...",1.5/4
3400,Beneath the Leaves,"A tricky plot doesn't save this half-speed mystery thriller, a bore that keeps us at arm's length despite a promising beginning and an accomplished cast.",1.5/4
3401,Beneath The Planet Of The Apes,The best it would seem the screenwriters would come up with was having another NASA astronaut crash-land on the planet in which apes are the dominant species and the humans inferior.,2/4
3402,Ben-Hur,Still making waves in movies today -- from The Phantom Menace's Podrace to the whole of Gladiator -- little can come close to captivating the grandeur and epic quality of William Wyler's magnificent bum numb-er.,5/5
3403,Benjamin,"A hilariously knowing tale of love, identity, and monks.",5/5
3404,Benji,Delightful family comedy starring the cuddly dog star.,5/5
3405,Benji,"This is all fairly dreary, in keeping with the franchise's long-running aversion to comedy and consistent fixation on bad familial vibes.",C+
3406,Benji: Off the Leash!,"It's Benji for Pete's sake and he's at least three times as expressive as Josh Hartnett or Halle Berry, so give a dog his due and shine that sun where it's supposed to.",2.5/4
3407,Benji the Hunted,Benji's lost in the wild! Get the kids!,3/5
3408,Benny & Joon,"The movie suggests that love and magic can overcome madness, and for at least the length of the film I was prepared to accept that. Much of the credit for that goes to Depp...",3/4
3409,Benny's Video,"A smug, contemptuous, passive-aggressive attack on the dehumanizing effects of media.",1.5/4
3410,Beowulf,"The final, kinetic aerial battle scenes are eye-poppingly spectacular -- especially in the 3D IMAX-version under review -- but they come way too late to save the film.",2/5
3411,Berberian Sound Studio,"Both times I have seen it, its vision, ingenuity and sheer gobsmacking audacity have blown me ten feet out of my seat.",5/5
3412,Bereavement,"Incredible improvement from Malevolence in terms of camerawork, score and performances. Bereavement paints a horrifyingly vivid picture of the mind of a psychopathic killer.",3.5/5
3413,Berlin: Symphony of a Great City (Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Großstadt),Outdated but still fine as an historical curio.,B
3414,"Berlin, I Love You","Limp anthology has brief nudity, language, adult themes.",1/5
3415,Berlin Syndrome,"Some might find the subject matter too bleak; others might wish it were pulpier. But on the whole, ""Berlin Syndrome"" is incredibly effective. It gets to know the innocent, while rendering the evil banal.",B
3416,Bernard and Huey,Mirvish has stylishly blended the past and present for a comfortable vibe that makes the film fun and cool despite the ridiculous relationship chaos swirling around.,8/10
3417,Bernie,"Jack Black delivers one of his strongest performances in this rather outrageous true story from East Texas, which Linklater tells with a witty blend of comedy, drama and documentary.",4/5
3418,"Bert Rigby, You're a Fool","Bert Rigby harkens back so effectively to the golden days that we want to be there, instead of in this movie.",2/4
3419,Beside Bowie: The Mick Ronson Story,The image Brewer leaves us with is powerful.,8/10
3420,Beside Still Waters,"With this exceptional debut, [director Chris Lowell] deserves to be considered one of most promising new talents in American independent cinema.",A
3421,Bessie,"Bessie is remarkably poignant, even if that resonance is somewhat disreputable.",2.5/4
3422,Best Friends,Best Friends is such a forgettable film I had no recollection of it ever being made.,2/5
3423,Best in Show,"Fans of offbeat humor will get a big kick out of this follow-up to Waiting for Guffman, but there will be more appreciative, 'Oh, that's funny!' comments than outright laughs.",3/5
3424,Best Laid Plans,[Best Laid Plans] is so concerned with being a film that it forgets to be a movie.,1/4
3425,Best Laid Plans,It isn't the smoothest transition but strong performances from Stephen Graham and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje keep the idea afloat.,3/5
3426,The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas,Not really the best.,3/5
3427,Best Men,Fairly witless romantic heist comedy combo.,2/5
3428,Best Night Ever,"The filmmakers make sure their female protagonists constantly look immature and irresponsible, and are intent on punishing them for wanting to have a good time.",1.5/4
3429,Best Of Enemies,"Almost as smart, funny and vicious as Buckley and Vidal themselves.",9/10
3430,The Best of Everything,It all seems trite and overly melodramatic.,C-
3431,Best Seller,"The problem is that Best Seller is light on plot, real light. It doesn't have a compelling story at its center, only the original inspiration of the best-selling cop and the killer who wants to talk.",1/4
3432,Best Worst Movie,A good way to kill a couple of hours.,3.5/5
3433,The Best Years of Our Lives,The feeling of warmth and satisfaction that accompanies the conclusion is the hallmark of a great drama.,4/4
3434,Bestiaire,This is a challenging and rewarding piece that reflects your own thoughts as much as those of the filmmaker.,4.5/5
3435,Bethany,The real problem comes from struggling to figure out who would actually enjoy this.,6/10
3436,Bethlehem,Most of the film plays out as a solid if uninspiring police procedural.,3/5
3437,Betsy's Wedding,"Betsy's Wedding assembles all of the materials for a human comedy, and then seems unconvinced by them.",2/4
3438,Better Days,"Three years ago, (Derek)Tsang made ""Soul Mate,"" an enchanting tale about female friendship that offered an engrossing look at modern, urban China. Yet that film isn't quite adequate preparation for the emotional wallop of ""Better Days.""",4.5/5
3439,Better Living Through Chemistry,A sexily chaotic parody of entitlement becomes just another tale of a white dude learning that there are worse things in life than essentially having no problems.,2/4
3440,Better Luck Tomorrow,"It is amusing and entertaining, and more than a little thought-provoking.",A-
3441,Better Start Running,It's difficult to find specific faults with the picture's construction when so much of it doesn't work.,D+
3442,Better than Chocolate,The makers of gay-themed films often ignore this rule: Romantic comedy clichs don't become innovative just because the lovers are the same sex.,2/4
3443,Better This World,"Better This World conveys the helplessness and hopelessness of what it's like to get caught in a system that, the film argues, values appearance over facts.",8.5/10
3444,A Better Tomorrow,Action!,4.5/5
3445,Better Watch Out,"You might think you're in for an icky, misogynist torture porn, and momentarily wish to leave the theater. (I did.) But stick it out, because the film will continue to defy your expectations.",B
3446,Bettie Page Reveals All,"""Bettie Page Reveals All!"" contributes heartily to her rich tradition as a feminist rebel with a cause.",A
3447,Betting on Zero,A documentary reminiscent of The Big Short on a smaller and less-successful scale.,B
3448,372 le Matin (Betty Blue) (37.2 Degrees in the Morning),"Love is not the same thing as nudity. This may seem obvious, but I feel it ought to be explained to director Jean-Jacques Beineix.",1.5/4

3452,Between the Lines,Enjoyable film.,B
3453,Between Two Ferns: The Movie,[T]here are enough big laughs packed into this scattershot adventure - structured around Zach Galifianakis' painfully awkward celebrity sit-downs - to warrant a viewing.,B-
3454,Between Us,"Between Us is strongly recommended for best friends, married couples, and those contemplating marriage at some future date.",5/5
3455,Between Us,"Though it runs into a couple of bumps along the way, Between Us is a well observed and sensitive indie drama that'll be familiar to anyone struggling with the onset of maturity.",7/10
3456,Between Worlds,"Crossing between the worlds of the living and dead is a concept that could populate any number of captivating and nuanced movies, but Between Worlds is not one of them.",0.5/5
3457,Beverly Hills Cop,This film illustrates some of the general sensibilities of 1980s America.,7/10
3458,Beverly Hills Cop II,"What is comedy? That's a pretty basic question, I know, but Cop II never thought to ask it.",1/4

3460,Beverly Hills Ninja,"A silly movie, with silly jokes and a silly story. But the talents at work in it are not silly.",4/5
3461,Beware Of Mr. Baker,"It's not easy to get past the shield of celebrity, and it's even harder to get past a persona as permanently entrenched as this one to see something genuine and unguarded, and that's what we get here.",A
3462,Beware the Gonzo,A dramedy set in the present day that doesn't seem to know much about the present day.,2/4

3470,Beyond Outrage,"Beyond Outrage is an effective deconstruction of the yakuza crime thriller that withholds the genre's usual thrills but retains a sense of humor. The result is a film that's thoughtful and affecting, even if it is a little slow at times.",8/10
3471,Beyond Rangoon,"Boorman's metaphysical musings might work if he integrated them more fully into his film, instead of making them secondary to action sequences.",2/4

3476,Beyond the Gates,...uncompromising...,3.5/4
3477,Beyond the Gates,"Beyond the Gates takes a halfway decent story idea (Jumanji/Zathura, only with a horror game this time) and renders it oddly inert.",1.5/5

3479,Beyond the Lights,Bythewood has purposely taken on an almost impossible scenario and made it something special.,B+
3480,Beyond The Mask,A faith-based swashbuckling Revolutionary War period piece that doesn't have the wit or the budget to quite come off.,2/4

3484,Beyond The Reach,A decent premise is ruined by poor execution and a ridiculous ending.,3/10
3485,Beyond the Sea,"Spacey clearly has a distinct respect and affection for the memory of old-school crooner Bobby Darin, and that emotion virtually pours from the screen in buckets.",4/5
3486,Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,"I can't call it a bad film, since all its eccentricities (including the groovy dialogue) were obviously lovingly placed there.",4/5
3487,Beyond the Visible - Hilma af Klint,"One needn't have a B.F.A. to see the striking resemblances between Klint's works, painted years earlier, and those of vastly more lauded male artists who came later",3/5
3488,Beyond Therapy,"It's a movie in which every scene must have seemed like a lot of fun at the time, but, when they're edited together, there's no pattern to the movie, nothing to build toward, no reason for us to care. It's all behavior.",1/4
3489,Bhaag Milkha Bhaag,"There are triumphs, both in front of and behind the camera, but they often get overshadowed by a story that tries to do too much.",2/4

3491,Bhoot (Ghost House),"Though at two hours this non-musical supernatural tale is considerably shorter than most mainstream Indian films, it's still slow going, padded with long shots of the troubled apartment building underscored by a soundtrack full of moans and screams.",2/5
3492,Bhoothnath,"Bhoothnath never finds a comfortable balance between broad comedy and the bittersweet relationship between Nath and Banku, each of whom fills a void in the other's existence.",2/4

3527,Big Kill,If you can accept the fact that Big Kill is a film with some rough edges - how I'd love to give them a mulligan on that terrible soundtrack - then you might just be surprised at how far a good location and a solid cast will get you.,2.5/5
3528,Big Liar on Campus,"I didn't know who Ryan Pinkston was before I watched Full of It, and now I pray to the cinema gods I will never have to wince through another one of his insufferable movies again.",D
3529,Big Miracle,Miracle eschews black and white - even the Inupiat have ulterior motives - for shades of grey.,2.5/4
3530,Big Momma's House,[Martin Lawrence] delivers.,3/5
3531,"Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son","It's amazing really, when you look back at the Big Momma's House film series, how many major crimes can be solved by dressing up as a fat woman.",2/5
3532,Big Muddy,"Atmospheric and absorbing, this well-crafted whodunit is rather reminiscent of Red Rock West.",4/4
3533,Big Night,"All-in-all, it's a warm, funny, and at the same time heartbreaking look at one big night in the company of some truly interesting people.",4/5
3534,Big Nothing,"Tense, cruel and hilariously absurd all at once, it may, as its title suggests, not add up to so very much, but it is a deliciously entertaining journey into the night which, at under 90 minutes, never overstays its welcome.",4/5
3535,The Big One,"The movie is smart, funny and edited cleverly; that helps conceal the fact that it's mostly recycled information.",3/4
3536,The Big Picture,"A very clever satire of Hollywood, film school, moviedom in general, and a few specific goofballs.",4/5
3537,The Big Red One,An American masterpiece by one of the last great American directors.,4/4
3538,The Big Shot-Caller,"Hallmark Channel formula is about all there is of a plot, and the leads are horrendously miscast",2/4

3540,Big Sky,Jorge Michel Grau's ambitions are stalled by a screenplay that seems to have never made it past a first draft.,1/4
3541,Big Star: Nothing Can Hurt Me,"A true passion project: A movie that is both a smart, definitive documentary and the ultimate love letter to its subject, the 1970s Memphis power pop band that proved vastly more popular and influential after its dissolution than when it was active.",3/4
3542,The Big Steal,"In this taut cat-and-mouse tale, all concerned are in top form.",B+
3543,Big Stone Gap,A heartfelt and earnest homespun comedy about the family ties that bind us all together.,3/5
3544,Big Sur,"The viewer is informed of a world of chaos, obsession, and irresolution, but has no cinematic means of accessing or understanding it.",1.5/4
3545,The Big Tease,Ferguson plays it all with so much heart you'll find yourself seriously rooting for a spiky-haired Scotsman.,3.5/5
3546,Big Top Pee-wee,"Big Top Pee-wee is as guileless and cheerful as Pee-wee's first movie, Pee-wee's Big Adventure, but it's not as magical.",2/4
3547,The Big Trail,Interesting early wide-screen spectacle with indifferent acting and story.,3/5
3548,Big Trouble,Sprawling comedy has a few laughs in it -- and the specter of recent events hanging over it.,2/5
3549,Big Trouble in Little China,"Special effects don't mean much unless we care about the characters who are surrounded by them, and in this movie the characters often seem to exist only to fill up the foregrounds.",2/4
3550,Big Wednesday,"Ambitious in goal, John Millius' tale suffers from an inconsistent tone, trying to be elegiac, nostalgic, and mythical in depicting the impact of Vietnam and aging on a clique of three surfers between 1962 and 1974 but the acting and imagery are good.",B-
3551,The Bigamist,Got trapped in a ridiculous deep-freeze as if trying its best to make the bigamist into an Albert Schweitzer.,B-

3554,Bigger Than the Sky,A sweet story can't overcome a seriously flawed film.,2.5/5
3555,Biggie and Tupac,"A worthwhile documentary, whether you're into rap or not, even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll.",3/5
3556,Biker Boyz,"The studio is touting the film as a ""contemporary Western"" but a ""two-hour hip-hop video with stank soap opera plot"" is more like it.",1/4
3557,Bikes vs Cars,"Bikes vs. Cars is no cinematic masterpiece, and it veers toward cheerleading in the last act, but it's an important film nonetheless, that will get you thinking about -- and perhaps rethinking -- how you get around.",3/5
3558,"Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator","Bikram is fairly tame; as a mass-media call to action, it's an essential movie of the moment.",B
3559,Bill,You'd have to be pretty grumpy not to enjoy it.,7/10
3560,Bill & Ted Face the Music,"Bill & Ted Face the Music proves itself worth the long wait as a thoughtful, thoroughly funny sequel that fits in perfectly with its most excellent predecessors.",4/5
3561,Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey,"This is a better sequel than anyone really had a right to expect, and it's well worth an hour and a half of your time.",3.5/5
3562,Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,"It's hard to argue with their simple philosophy 'be excellent to each other', and the sheer warm-heartedness of this film means that it is always a delight to watch.",4/5
3563,Bill Burr: Paper Tiger,"Sweet, tender, and open-hearted, Bill Burr's 'Paper Tiger' isn't always what you'd expect from the comedian, but it's as good as anything he's done in years.",B+
3564,Bill Cunningham New York,"Bill Cunningham is astutely defined by Bill Cunningham New York as not simply a traditional photographer of clothing, but an anthropological historian.",3/4
3565,Billion Dollar Brain,It is a spy movie that commits the unforgivable sin of losing track of its plot.,2/4
3566,Billionaire Boys Club,"As Hunt's life unravels, so does the movie, though the story maintains a certain baseline of interest just by virtue of being sordid.",2/4
3567,Billionaire Ransom (Take Down),"A couple of distinctive moments stand out amidst the tedium, such as a rather innovative use for a compound fracture, but everything about Take Down is an overfamiliar slog from start to finish that holds no surprises or excitement.",3/10
3568,Billy Bathgate,"All of the leads here -- especially Hoffman, big surprise there -- are top notch and thoroughly believable in their roles. Unfortunately, it seems no one thought out just what their roles should be.",2.5/5
3569,Billy Elliot,"The young actor does his best, and, whereas we certainly root for his character, the movie is just too formulaic to be able to recommend it.",7/10
3570,Billy Jack,A film so fascinatingly liberal it almost seems to exist in a different universe.,4/5
3571,Billy Jack Goes to Washington,This Billy Jack film at least provides a nice shift back to the title character as a focus.,2.5/5
3572,Billy Liar,One of the great movies of the 1960's.,4/5
3573,Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,PTSD 3D drama with the motion smoothing feature still on.,C+
3574,Billy Madison,"Yet another forgettable and asinine entry into the Adam Sandler oeuvre, Billy Madison is ridiculous and stupid yet, ashamedly, made me laugh from time to time.",2/5
3575,Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss,"At times it is shamelessly disposable, but that is also its most endearing quality.",3/5
3576,Biloxi Blues,"The movie Mike Nichols has directed from the play is pale, shallow, unconvincing and predictable, and tells us less about the characters than we already know.",1.5/4
3577,Iceman,"Hopefully, the second instalment of this two-parter film, slated for release later this year, has got the puerile humour out of its system to focus on only the action.",2.5/5
3578,Bio-Dome,America faces the very real prospect that Pauly Shore is the most annoying comic alive.,0/4

3581,Bird Box,"Bier's direction is coolly efficient, which fits the material to a t - anything more ostentatious would just feel wasteful.",B
3582,Bird on a Wire,"We don't believe the characters, and so the elaborate chases and escapes and stunts and special effects are all affectations.",2.5/4
3583,Bird People,"...we just found it too oblique, too delighted with itself, and frankly, too dull, to admire it much. It's probably a good thing that it exists, but it's not for us.",C
3584,L'uccello dalle piume di cristallo (The Bird With the Crystal Plumage),"While Plumage may not demand active spectatorship, the two-killer theory of Tenebre and Stendhal Syndrome makes its first appearance in an Argento film.",3.5/4
3585,The Birdcage,The beauty of The Birdcage is that its jokes and its message are one and the same. These characters couldn't change themselves if they tried. And only a fool would want them to.,A-

3588,Birdman,"Hubristic, humble, heartfelt and hotheaded, ""Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)"" is phenomenal.",A
3589,Birdman of Alcatraz,"Lancaster's brilliant performance anchors Frankenheimer's fine film, a liberal-minded, optimistic celebration of the power of redemption.",81/100
3590,Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),Birds of Prey is among the best of DC. Margot Robbie once again kills it as Harley Quinn with Jurnee Smollett-Bell impressing as Black Canary. Black Mask is arguably the best DC Villain so far. What a Ride!,4/5
3591,Birdy,"Quiet, thoughtful, and really quite touching. Cage and Modine do some great work together. And that Peter Gabriel score!",4/5
3592,Birth,"It's beautifully made and very well-acted, tantalising us with its central mystery even if it's rather mopey and dull.",3/5
3593,The Birth of a Nation,"A controversial, explicitly racist, but landmark American film masterpiece - these all describe ground-breaking producer/director D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915). The domestic melodrama/epic originally premiered with the title...",A
3594,Birth of the Dragon,Trying to get the audience to care even a little about any character not named Bruce Lee or Wong Jack Man is a losing battle.,2/5

3596,Birthday Girl,None of Birthday Girl's calculated events take us by surprise...,2.5/4
3597,Bit,Nicole Maines delivers a commanding presence in Bit as the film becomes the queer feminist vampire movie that we've been needing for so long.,5/5
3598,Bitch,"Though I'm still hard pressed to define the film's themes or direction, I can't say that the experience of watching it roll around in the dirt didn't come with ample intrigue.",3/5
3599,Bite,Chad Archibald doesn't quite land Bite's transition over from claustrophobic character study into full-blown monster movie.,2/4
3600,Bite the Bullet,"Bite the Bullet may be many things, but boring it's not.",88/100
3601,Bitter Moon,"I'm not sure what audience Polanski intended this movie for, but I'm obviously not in the target group.",2/4
3602,Bitter Feast,"Beyond its creepy back story, the horror in this morally confused and cinematically inert film is entirely nominal.",1.5/4
3603,Bitter Harvest,Overused plot points and a bland leading man cripple this account of love and horror during the Soviet-enforced famine of Ukraine of the 1930s,2/4
3604,Die Bitteren Tränen der Petra von Kant (The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant),Wildly overrated,1.5/5
3605,Bitter Victory,...characters remain woefully underdeveloped.,1.5/4
3606,Biutiful,"This Cannes Festival competition entry may be too dark and depressing for mainstream audiences, but it is clearly the heartfelt and very personal achievement of a master filmmaker with a potentially award winning performance from its star.",4.5/5
3607,Black,"Bhansali built a visually beautiful film around the story of ""The Miracle Worker."" It is hard to imagine such an elegant and satisfying film coming from the Bollywood system.",8/10
3608,Black and White,"Everything he has to say is up there on the screen in black and white, often underlined just for good measure.",3/10
3609,Black '47,"By the time it ends on a note of intimate ambiguity, it's hard not to wish that Black 47 had expressed more shades of gray.",C+
3610,The Black Balloon,It's a very auspicious debut for this young Australian filmmaker.,4/5
3611,Black Book,"Verhoeven's complex saga moves quickly and decisively, deftly balancing the political and personal while exploring daring and cowardice in WWII and how the War erased distinctions based on simplistic labels of good and evil",A-
3612,Black Butterflies,"As far as middlebrow biopics go, it may not break any molds, but it's a reasonably sensitive and occasionally insightful look into the mind and psyche of an impassioned and deeply troubled artist.",2.5/4
3613,Black Butterfly,Relatively entertaining and well-acted until one twist too many. at the very end.,6/10
3614,Black Caesar,"Mr. Williamson, in short, can't be blamed for the plot contrivances that hinge mostly on action and bloodshed.",2/5
3615,The Black Cauldron,...it serves a purpose in reminding us that even today's animation can't compare to the brilliance that hand-drawn animation offers its audience.,4/4

3617,Black Christmas,Can't help but feel like a missed opportunity to truly stick it to the man.,2.5/5
3618,Black Coffee,"Projects personality and integrity, submitting a warm relationship drama with a few good laughs and a desire to inspire viewers, trying to make the world a better place. It's hard to argue with such a friendly objective.",B
3619,Black Cop,Bowles does a fantastic job of intercutting real footage into some scenes that spark a visceral reaction and shapes the film's narrative to remind you that these moments are very real.,4.5/5
3620,The Black Dahlia,"The tragedy of Black Dahlia is that there is no finality for anyone--solving the ""mystery,"" so to speak, counts for next-to-nothing.",4/4
3621,Black Death,"There aren't many British horror films you could call Bergmanesque with even slim justification, but Christopher Smith's Black Death is out of the ordinary.",4/5

3623,Black Dynamite,"This movie will make you say ""Oooooooooo!""",3.5/5
3624,Black Friday,There's a lot of material covered in the film and its structure ... requires an audience to pay careful and close attention. But [director Anurag] Kashyap keeps the action moving and the overall movie turns out to be engrossing.,B+
3625,Black Hawk Down,"Black Hawk Down is both brainless and punishing, worth taking in solely for being less entertaining than your usual Bruckheimer dud.",2.5/4
3626,Black Knight,Black Knight's first half is a consistent hoot.,2.5/4
3627,Black Magic for White Boys,"Black Magic for White Boys interprets us, irritates us, worries us. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
3628,Black Mask,"The action sequences, hyperkinetic almost to a fault, make you forget they're saying really cheesy things that you hope were mistranslated.",3.5/5
3629,Black Mass,"Johnny Depp gives an utterly chilling performance as the notorious James ""Whitey"" Bulger in Boston-set crime drama Black Mass.",3/5
3630,Black Moon Rising,Entirely forgettable car chase flick.,2/5
3631,Black Narcissus,"Black Narcissus is a masterly exploration of the dangers of ambition, British reserve, and unbridled emotion. The acting is superb, particularly Kathleen Byron as Sister Ruth, and the emotional crescendo builds steadily throughout the film.",5/5
3632,Black Nativity,"Straightforward but convincing, Black Nativity is refreshingly restrained, making it a nice counterpoint to other, noisier holiday entertainment.",B-
3633,Black November,"Everything here is either too weird or too preachy to make an impact, unless you're really, really into being lectured to for 95 minutes.",1.5/4
3634,Black Ops,"Stairs demonstrates Paton's passion and hunger for the science-fiction genre, and it'll be interesting to see what he can really do when he gets let loose with a much bigger budget.",3/5

3636,The Black Orchid,"Quinn cria um personagem carismtico, mas o elenco feminino parece formado apenas por figuras paranicas e controladoras.",2/5
3637,Black Orpheus (Orfeu Negro),"This probably isn't the way you remembered the tale -- set amidst sweaty dancers at Carnaval -- but it's certainly, well, different.",3.5/5

3639,Black Panther,"The women of Black Panther do so much throughout the film, all while being funny, sensuous, smart and strong.",5/5
3640,Black Pond,"Langham's performance may not rehabilitate his career. Perhaps nothing could do that. But Black Pond is really good: haunting, melancholy and strange.",4/5
3641,Black Robe,"Black Robe is a film of enormous interest for those who care about the early history of Europeans in North America, but for ordinary moviegoers it will be very tough going.",2.5/4
3642,Black Rock,"The shotgun wedding of mumblecore and bare-bones genre filmmaking is promising in theory, but lackluster and surprisingly generic in practice.",C-

3646,Black Sheep,Pretty impressive work from a first-time filmmaker who aimed for equal portions of broad humor and gore galore -- and nailed both genres right on the mutton.,4/5
3647,Black Site,Black Site is a modern sci-fi tale with elements of Carpenter and Lovecraft while also having heart.,7/10
3648,Black Snake Moan,Filled with sly pleasures for those who can throttle their inner puritan to the floor long enough to find them.,3.5/5
3649,The Black Stallion,One of those rare family films that goes on to earn true Classic status.,5/5

3652,Black Swan,"Powerful, gripping and always intriguing...",4/5
3653,Black Water,"Van Damme and Lundgren can't see to ""quit"" each other. Action bowzers like ""Black Water"" suggest that they try.",1/4
3654,The Black Waters of Echo's Pond,That The Black Waters of Echo's Pond is receiving a theatrical release without being a remake or studio-financed is an achievement in itself. It's just too bad the finished product couldn't be of higher quality.,2/4
3655,Black White + Gray: A Portrait of Sam Wagstaff and Robert Mapplethorpe,"Relatively tame retrospective about the relationship of a gay patron of the arts and his famous photographer lover best remembered for graphic, homoerotic snapshots featuring shocking sights like that of a bullwhip in a tight place.",3/4
3656,Blackballed: The Bobby Dukes Story,"For the price of one hour's catering on your average Hollywood comedy, Blackballed delivers probably three times the laughs.",4/5

3662,Blackhat,"There are fifty things about Blackhat that make no sense. But on a visceral level, it works.",6/10
3663,BlacKkKlansman,"Blackkklansman is an excoriating, unapologetic s--- on the chest of Trumpians and their nativist agenda, and may well serve as one of the defining films of this era just as Birth of a Nation and Gone With The Wind did in theirs.",A-
3664,Blackthorn,Mateo Gil certainly can be held responsible for turning the iconic outlaw into a paper-thin Clint Eastwood-Unforgiven clich.,1.5/4

3668,Blade II,Blade II is gooey and dank yet Del Toro recognizes the allure of the original's techno-pulse.,3.5/4
3669,Blade of the Immortal (Mugen no jûnin),"The film suffers from the elephantiasis endemic to big-budget manga adaptations. Fans want to see their favorite characters and stories, producers oblige, and the result is a two-hour-+ running time packed with self-indulgent bloat.",2/5
3670,Blade Runner,Actually the last movie that I had liked so much that I bothered to go to cinema for the second time. Never again I was so blown away by cinematic quality to buy tickets for repeated viewing.,10/10
3671,Blade Runner (The Final Cut),"Perhaps on its deepest level, ""Blade Runner"" explores ... a theme as old as Genesis and the myth of Prometheus, and iterated in ""Paradise Lost,"" Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein,"" and in Blake's arcane, visionary mythology.",4/4
3672,Blade Runner 2049,"This film is stop-and-point stunning. It is not without problems, however.",3/5

3675,Blair Witch,BLAIR WITCH is chilling and intense. It is a truly terrifying cinematic experience.,9/10

3680,Blancanieves,"Blancanieves is a beautifully crafted, if not entirely successful throwback to a golden age of filmmaking from nearly a century ago, a lovely excursion back to a previous era.",B-
3681,Blank City,Celine Danhier's documentary about New York's punk and post punk era of underground DIY filmmaking is an ecstatic examination of the artists who everything they had into creating something original.,A-
3682,Blank Check,One of those smart-aleck kid adventures that manages to be entirely obnoxious with very little effort.,1/5
3683,Blankman,Some of this is mildly amusing but there is a mean spirit that undercuts the laughs and the violence is surprisingly harsh.,1.5/4
3684,Blast From the Past,"Okay, it's funny. I even laughed out loud. More than once.",3/5

3686,Blaze,"The film isn't a jigsaw puzzle, where every piece neatly fits into a greater whole; it's more like a drunken night of people sitting around and remembering their old friend, warts and all.",B-
3687,Blazing Saddles,"[The] huge popularity of this film, still uncontested after so many years, really shouldn't be that surprising.",8/10

3689,Bleak Street (La calle de la amargura),"Bleakness, Arturo Ripstein's film implies, demands different kinds of labor from a man than from a woman.",3.5/4
3690,Bleed,"Bleed is familiar, by-the-numbers horror filmmaking, but it's also short and sweet enough to capitalize on cheap thrills.",7/10
3691,Bleed For This,It's a story of strength that crumples; a portrait of vitality that plays awfully flat.,2/5
3692,Bleeding Heart,"""Bleeding Heart"" may deliver some much needed catharsis, but it's ultimately a hollow film that isn't concerned with consequences or the echoing cycle of violence, just vanquishing the bad guy, reclaiming a dime store sense of freedom, and not much more.",C-
3693,Bleeding Steel,"It is not just the premise of the story that fails to convince. The design of the film, from the costumes to the set, is so nonsensical that it becomes unintentionally funny.",2.5/5
3694,Blended,The Wedding Singer director Frank Coraci mines few laughs from the script but Sandler fans will find something to enjoy. They usually do.,2/5
3695,"Bless Me, Ultima",The film's interest in social themes remains background fodder within a far more generic good-versus-evil narrative.,2.5/4

3697,Blessed Child,Filmmaker Cara Jones offers a poignant testament to the baggage and insecurities hounding her own life.,2.5/4
3698,Blessed Is the Match: The Life and Death of Hannah Senesh,Remarkable for bringing a little-known story of one woman's great courage and conviction to our attention but is most notable for director Roberta Grossman's dully strenuous cinematic sense.,2.5/4
3699,Blind Chance (Przypadek),More enlightening than entertaining.,B
3700,Blind,"A sexy, funny and thrilling trip through the human imagination.",9/10
3701,Blind,"The film makes a bold but foolish move by getting in the ring with Tolstoy, analogizing itself to Anna Karenina in a self-seriously laughable attempt to pass its schmaltzy and contrived romance narrative off for something significantly grander.",1.5/4

3703,Blind Fury,Solid B-level actioner with lots of mayhem and the great Rutger Hauer.,3/5
3704,Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary,An occasionally interesting but also flat documentary that too often fails to ask the best questions of its willing subject.,2.5/5
3705,Blinded by the Light,A Technicolor ode to the power of music so deeply tender and heartfelt that it disarms even the most misanthropic critic's instincts.,B+

3710,Blinky Bill The Movie,It's ... refreshing to see an Australian movie so heart-on-sleeve about expressing national character.,3/5

3914,The Boy Who Could Fly,"Here is a sweet and innocent parable about a boy who could fly -- and about a girl who could fly, too.",3/4
3915,Boy Wonder,"Though the story eventually develops some shading, Mr. Morrissey's enthusiasm for graphic novels is evident in every overstylized frame and underwritten conversation.",2/5
3916,Boyhood,What an astonishing achievement; what a beautiful movie.,5/5
3917,Boynton Beach Club,Boynton Beach Bereavement Club never aims to be much more than sweet. If only it had hit that mark a little more often.,2/5

3919,Boys Don't Cry,"A haunting, superbly made film.",3.5/4
3920,Boys of Abu Ghraib,"For a film about the hardened soldiers who oversaw the most notorious detainment center of the Iraq War, Boys Of Abu Ghraib is remarkably squeamish about tackling its subject matter head-on.",1.5/5

3925,Bra Boys,"""Bra Boys"" exposes a specific slice of rebellious Australian surfing culture hardboiled from the senseless violence visited upon them by authorities and rival gangs alike. Maroubra means, ""place of thunder."" Upon seeing this gripping movie, you'll know wh",B+
3926,Brad's Status,Brad's Status is a simple yet brilliant film that is one of the biggest surprises of the year.,9/10
3927,Brahman Naman,"Proves to be more layered than its promises of shenanigans may expect, especially as this is the rare sex comedy that doesn't glorify the male gaze.",3/4
3928,Brahms: The Boy II,"While sometimes too silly for its own good, Brahms: The Boy II gets enough right to make you forget the silliness of its concept. Annabelle and Chucky will have to make room for Brahms on the shelf.",3/4
3929,Braid,"A gorgeously vibrant and yet shockingly violent bourgeois horror-comedy that relishes in its three female leads, proving that femininity can be deadly.",9/10

3931,Brain Dead,I felt cheated by its wearisome ploy of not decifering what was a dream and what was reality.,C

3933,Brain on Fire,"As the drama ramps up, we're stuck firmly in dreary TV movie territory and Moretz starts to struggle with the challenges of the role.",2/5
3934,Brainscan,"Brainscan is interesting not so much because of the plot, the murders, and the Trickster, as because of its portrait of a teenage boy living at one remove from the world.",2/4
3935,Brake,"Until its pair of ludicrous twist endings, which complicates its message and logistics in ways that make little sense, Gabe Torres's Brake plays like a more simplistic version of Buried tailored specifically to a hawkish right-wing crowd.",0.5/4
3936,Brampton's Own,Watchable the way a baseball game involving teams long out of contention is still watchable. You'd rather being seeing a contender.,2/4
3937,Bran Nue Dae,"A refreshing entry into the recent canon of Australian films, Bran Nue Dae recalls the innocent, playful tone of classics such as Muriel's Wedding and The Castle and, as such, deserves to be the summer smash of 2010.",4/5
3938,Branded,This movie makes absolutely no sense.,1/4
3939,Branded to Kill,It's a knockout.,A
3940,The Brandon Teena Story,"The film itself is not slick and accomplished... Oddly enough, this is an effective style for this material; it captures the banality of the world in which individuality is seen as a threat.",3/4
3941,Brannigan,"It's a Western, really, but then most cop movies are, these days. I guess it's cheaper to film in a city.",2/4
3942,Bratz: The Movie,"The storyline is almost too easy to rag on, what with its almost complete incoherence and dead-serious evocation of Mean Girls by way of McNamara's own Raise Your Voice.",0.5/4
3943,The Bravados,Stumbles when it catches a bad case of religion.,B
3944,Brave,"Amiable, action-packed without being overbearing about it, and marked by a new level of visual complexity, even by Pixar standards, Brave peddles a pleasant but somewhat conventional tale with assurance and panache.",4/5

3949,Bravetown,"This isn't ""Bravetown."" It's Crazytown.",0/5
3950,Brawl in Cell Block 99,"It's a richly drawn crime and punishment fable, a noirish b-movie with real fondness for its cinematic forerunners, an extravagantly gory exploitation flick and a blistering showcase for the Vaughnaissance.",A-
3951,Breach,"As a follow-up to Shattered Glass, this fact-based thriller is a logical step for Billy Ray since both films deal with trust and betrayal, except that here the scope is wider and the goal more ambitious and political.",B
3952,Bread & Tulips,Completely by-the-book in its light feel-good ways.,2/4
3953,Break Ke Baad,"Break Ke Baad is the latest in the long line of recent Bollywood rom coms which starts off with what must have seemed like a good idea on paper, but comes off looking and feeling lame.",1.5/5
3954,Break Point,"Thanks to witty writing and excellent performances, Break Point turns out to be one of the funniest sports comedies that we've seen in years.",8/10
3955,The Break-Up,"Aggressively marketed as anti-romantic comedy, this War of the Exes is endless parade of bickering in which Aniston is even less charming than the usual! For nastier and funnier separation comedies, rent War of the Roses and Albert Brooks' Modern Romance.",C-

3959,Breakfast with Scot,While Breakfast With Scot delivers the requisite humour -- not to mention some old-fashioned Christmas magic -- it stands apart for its hearty helping of food for thought.,3/4

3962,Breaking A Monster,"It's a charming and engaging mix - the antithesis of Metallica's ego overload, and just as watchable.",4/5
3963,Breaking and Entering,"Like last year's Academy Award-winning Crash, Breaking and Entering is about random collisions between classes and cultures. It's also just as contrived.",2/5
3964,Breaking & Exiting,"Breaking and Exiting is in theaters this weekend, and that's about the best compliment it can be given.",D
3965,Breaking Away,...provides a sense of encouragement for everyone who watches it...a winsome and engaging little film.,8/10
3966,Breaking In,"Breaking In is a clever twist on the home invasion genre, with a dynamic lead performance by Gabrielle Union as a mother protecting her family.",7.2/10
3967,Daai si gin (Breaking News),"To took a shot at a big fat bull's-eye and, for the most part, missed.",2.5/5

3969,Breaking the Waves,"As frustrating as it is rewarding, this makes compulsive viewing nonetheless.",3/5
3970,Breaking Upwards,Makes one yet again wonder why filmmakers continually attempt to create art that will last out of relationships that didn't.,2.5/4
3971,Breakthrough,Breakthrough is an emotionally moving film that faith-based families and individuals are really going to enjoy. Secular audiences may find it to be cheesy.,B+
3972,Breakup at a Wedding,"If you're the kind who is always up for a calamity-filled trip down the aisle, ""Breakup at a Wedding"" is a moderately amusing application of the formula.",3/5
3973,Breath Of The Gods,"It lacks narrative momentum but not warm humour or extreme headstands: you won't need telling twice that certain moves are ""definitely not for beginners"".",3/5
3974,Breathe,"A mainstream endeavour that is both uncynical and well-intentioned, so there's no issues here with its distinct accessibility.",3/5
3975,Breathe In,It is a finely calibrated piece of work from one of the more talented US film-makers to emerge in recent years.,4/5
3976,Breathless,"A revolution swept French cinema into the 1960s, and this film seized the public by its throat.",5/5
3977,Breezy,It plays out as a sappy meeting between representatives of the Counterculture and Establishment.,C+
3978,Brian Banks,"The story of Brian Banks is especially pertinent in the #MeToo era. It is a harrowing, insightful look into an appalling miscarriage of justice. Brian Banks reminds us that the pendulum of truth must swing both ways.",3.5/5
3979,Brick,"Writer/Director Rian Johnson goes back to the old days when characters were rocks, dialogue was king and the plot demanded you pay attention to every last bit.",3.5/4
3980,Brick Lane,"Based on Monica Ali's bestselling novel, this is an insightful look at a woman searching across cultural barriers for a place to belong. Not only is it a strong story, but it's great to see such an involving film set in London's Asian-Muslim community.",4/5
3981,Brick Mansions,"An adrenaline-soaked thrill ride with a delicious sting in the tail, Brick Mansions is superior action entertainment and a fittingly spectacular send-off for Paul Walker.",9/10
3982,The Bride,Blasphemously bad rehash of Bride of Frankenstein.,1/5
3983,Bride and Prejudice,"Cleverly turns Jane Austen's classic story into a colourful Bollywood epic that's thoroughly good fun, even if it doesn't live up to the promise.",3/5
3984,Bride Flight,An expensively filmed chick flick about three Dutch women who seek a better life among the Kiwis.,B
3985,Bride of Chucky,"Has a genuinely goofy premise, and is far more original than the other sequels. But if you look at it as a horror film, which it is, that is where the film fails.",2/4
3986,The Bride of Frankenstein,The Bride of Frankenstein has an in-your- face audacity that hasn't dimmed all that much after 63 years.,4/4
3987,Bride of Re-Animator,In dire need of Stuart Gordon's direction.,2/5

3989,Bride of the Monster,"Bad, bad, bad. Have you not yet been introduced to Ed Wood?",1/5
3990,Bride of the Wind,Alma Mahler charmed virtually all the creative men of Vienna at the turn of the 20th Century but from Bruce Beresford's staid direction you'd scarcely see why.,2.5/4

3992,Bridegroom,"Highly emotional, even sentimental...",2.5/4
3993,The Brides of Dracula,One of the better horror films put out by the schlock Hammer studio.,C+
3994,Brideshead Revisited,"The theme of individual powerlessness in the face of family, religion and other forces is dusted off in this version, and while the production design is impeccable, helmer Jarrold is only sporadically effective in illuminating the novel's dramatic issues",B-
3995,Bridesmaids,Kristin Wiig is the best film comedienne since Madeline Kahn.,A-
3996,Bridge of Spies,"Hanks has never seemed more like a modern Jimmy Stewart, drink in hand, just looking to get home to his bed, as the script leans into its cavalcade of slightly bizarre negotiations with Eastern European goons.",4/5
3997,The Bridge on the River Kwai,"A tense, terrifying, absolutely riveting film about the ironies of war and the deadly psychological games enemy soldiers play with each other.",9/10
3998,Bridge to Terabithia,This is easily the best family feature of the early year.,3.5/4
3999,A Bridge Too Far,"Fantastic WW2 epic with a 1970's ""all star"" cast.",5/5
4000,The Bridges at Toko-Ri,The Bridges at Toko-Ri effectively depicts the sacrifices and courage of those who went to war.,B
4001,The Bridges of Madison County,"As director, Eastwood has decided to go for cinematic poetry, and occasionally he manages to achieve just that.",2.5/4
4002,Bridget Jones's Diary,Is it too early to talk about an Oscar nomination for Zellweger?,3/4
4003,Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason,"If you liked the original, you'll like this one, only not quite as much.",2.5/4
4004,Bridget Jones's Baby,"A warm, witty and welcome return - intelligently evolved and an absolute hoot. As Bridget would say: 'v.good'.",4/5
4005,A Brief History of Time,"I'm pleased I saw the film, such as it is, but it doesn't do justice to Hawking's genius or to Morris' own genius, and I was left with the question of whether even Morris had ever finished the book.",2.5/4
4006,Brief Interviews with Hideous Men,Brief Interviews With Hideous Men is a noble failure of a film that's worth a lot more than many of the safer if more achieved works premiering beside it at Sundance 2009.,3/5
4007,Brigadoon,"Brigadoon[is]...a concocted Technicolor plaid-clad Garden of Eden with a ""puppet show"" residue.",3.5/5
4008,Bright,"In the end, Bright pulls off the uncommon (and not at all admirable) hat trick of being confusing, boring, and vaguely insulting about the matters it wants to appear smart on.",1/5
4009,Bright Eyes,...my tolerance for Shirley Temple's brand of sugary lightheartedness is rather limited.... But it would be churlish of me to deny the little moppet's winning charisma.,7/10
4010,Bright Leaves,"Ostensibly about an epic betrayal, Bright Leaves spirals beautifully in a hundred different directions.",3.5/4
4011,Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,What the film is really about is the bond between a mother and daughter who through it all can still bring a little joy into each others lives and the daughter who is holding onto that moment as long as she can.,A-
4012,Bright Star,"A solid, rather restrained rendition of John Keats' final years, Campion's period piece avoids pitfalls and cliches of the biopic genre, and while not illuminating of Keats as a unique poet, it does convey the taste of first love.",B
4013,Bright Young Things,"Writer-actor Fry takes an ambitious approach to the British period film, adapting Evelyn Waugh's novel Vile Bodies into a lively and densely populated romantic comedy.",3/5
4014,Brightburn,"Brightburn has a horror tinge -- there are some gory scenes and real wincing moments (glass in the eye, anyone?) -- but otherwise it feels airless and repetitive.",2/5
4015,Brightest Star,The cast gets too-cute-by-half dialogue so they can show off how witty they are. Too bad no amount of actual wit could cover for a weak male lead and an emotionally stunted story.,1.5/5
4016,Brighton Beach Memoirs,The stage version of Brighton Beach Memoirs seemed much more alive than this film.,2/4
4017,Brighton Rock,"Rowan Joffe is an extremely talented artist and one of the jewels in the crown of British cinema at present, but this film is pointless and uninspiring, and far from his best work.",2/5
4018,Brigsby Bear,I couldn't think of a more appropriate feature screenplay or leading role debut for Mooney than Brigsby Bear-an earnest salute to the weirdo in all of us.,3.5/5
4019,Brilliant Lies,LaPaglia can make reading the alphabet exciting...,2.5/4
4020,Brimstone,"Brimstone is hampered somewhat by its ponderous, doom-laden pace, and resultant bloated running time, but remains an intriguing slant on the spaghetti western ...",3/5

4022,Bring It On: All or Nothing,"If those are my choices, I'll go with 'nothing.'",1/5
4023,Bring Me the Head of the Machine Gun Woman (Tráiganme la cabeza de la mujer metralleta),"The video game-inspired visuals, pulsing synth score and manic level of energy make it quite the ride indeed.",3/5
4024,Bringing Down the House,There are enough genuine laughs to keep things fun and undemanding...Queen Latifah steals the film.,2.5/4
4025,Bringing Out the Dead,"The movie is a riveting, yet often times amusing portrait of what it's like to reach the haunting edge of insanity.",A-
4026,Bringing Up Baby,"Comedian Harold Lloyd called this the most perfectly constructed comedy he'd ever seen, and he was right.",4/4
4027,Bringing Up Bobby,"Just an extended dramatization of the 1980s anti-drug PSA that memorably cautioned ""I learned it by watching you!""",1/4
4028,Britannia Hospital,"The bitterness of the satire has served to marginalize Anderson's final chapter. See it, but be aware that it's a chilly blast of unpleasantly cold air.",4.5/5
4029,Britt-Marie Was Here,"[Backman] and director Tuva Novotny keep the characters astringent and his tone wry, so it never gets cuddly or cloying.",3/4

4035,Broadway: The Golden Age,"Overstuffed with star power, but curiously lacking in focus.",2.5/5
4036,Brokeback Mountain,What Ang Lee has wrought with his stunning contemplation of two men who find love in a lonely place is more about universal human needs than about gender preferences.,4/4

4038,Broken,"Too often looks strained, desperately self-conscious and replete with unconvincing and unearned emotional crises.",2/5
4039,Broken City,"Flawed, but gritty, ambitious -- a thriller that hides its secrets well.",2.5/4
4040,Broken Embraces,"Feels like a mixed bag of smart ideas and nods to other pictures, rather than a coherent, distinct work of art.",2/5
4041,Broken English,"This crosscultural romance, an updated version of Hollywood's Three Coins in the Fountain and Summertime, has a more resonant subtext than text.",B-
4042,Broken Flowers,Broken Flowers ends on a pleasingly poignant note without relinquishing its sense of gentle absurdity.,3.5/5
4043,The Broken Hearts Club,"Unless you want to see a former Superman playing a gay guy, The Broken Hearts Club has disappointingly little to offer.",D
4044,Broken Horses,Good-hearted but daft.,3/5
4045,Broken Lance,"O roteiro (vencedor do Oscar, acredite ou no)  cheio de clichs; e o final, esquemtico. Katy Jurado foi indicada ao prmio aparentemente por dizer 'My hOsband' o tempo todo.",2/5
4046,Broken Tower,"The Broken Tower feels unique as a young man's tribute to an adventuresome, doomed soul.",3/5
4047,Bronco Billy,"If you can overlook the warm fuzzies of this film, it can be charming, lighthearted fun.",7/10
4048,Bronson,"Dark, intelligent and disturbing, supported by a force-of-nature lead performance and a clever screenplay.",4/5
4049,A Bronx Tale,"A Bronx Tale is a very funny movie sometimes, and very touching at other times. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes.",4/4
4050,The Brood,"A stunningly original film, but one that is hardly plausible.",C+
4051,Brooklyn,"It's the sweet sincerity of ""Brooklyn"" that stamps it as both refreshing and nostalgic. The film is as welcome as a photo you just discovered of your mother before you were born, in which she looks prettier than you ever imagined.",3/4
4052,Brooklyn Castle,"a truly wonderful, uplifting film - because it's an emotional experience that's driven by appreciating and celebrating what these young kids can do.",A
4053,Brooklyn Lobster,"Kevin Jordan's small family drama, set in Sheepshead Bay, is an unusually pure example of American kitchen-sink realism.",2.5/5
4054,Brooklyn Rules,"A surprisingly strong feature about lifelong buddies, one taking the high road to college and law school while two others are drawn into the life of wiseguys.",B+
4055,Brooklyn's Finest,"As crime-policier, this follow-up to Fuqua's brilliant Training Day (for which Denzel Washington won an Oscar), is inferior in every way, dramatically (too familiar) and especially acting-wise; Gere lacks gravitas and no chemistry between the other men.",C

4062,Brotherhood,"Despite a running time of less than 70 minutes (- the credits), still outstays its welcome.",2/5

4071,The Brothers McMullen,"This is not a ""religious"" film, and the brothers are far from saints. But they know right and wrong, and in their imperfect ways they are struggling to attain a state of grace. Sometimes they slip. Sometimes they don't struggle so hard. Life's like that.",3/4
4072,Brothers of the Head,"This dark and sometimes blackly humorous drama, told cinema vrit style, is of a different intent, and miles away from the type of comedy normally associated with that word.",4/4

4076,Bruce Almighty,"Carrey forces it early on, stiff, awkward. But becomes comfortable once he gets those God Powers. He's funny, but it's Steve Carell who garnishes the film's belly laughs.",2.5/4

4078,Bruno,The crown of the reigning king of bad taste must pass from John Waters to Sacha Baron Cohen.,3/5

4088,Bucky Larson: Born to Be a Star,"Is there a staler target for satire than the porn industry? Is there any humor left to be gleaned from describing X-rated acts in G-rated language? Bucky Larson suggests there isn't, yet it plunges ahead all the same.",D-

4146,Burton And Taylor,"Burton and Taylor delivered surprises and careful insights, and whether or not any of it was technically true (though I'm sure it was), it didn't matter. At the end of the day, as a story about two people we thought we knew, it worked.",A-
4147,Burt's Buzz,...an uneven yet entertaining little documentary.,2.5/4
4148,Burying the Ex,"What we get here is not a reinvention, it's the wholesale reanimation of something that had been buried for a long while. Like the shambling zombie corpse it is, initially we're glad to see it come back to life, but pretty soon it starts to decompose.",B-

4215,Camilla,Camilla is too arbitrary and disorganized for me to recommend... But there are some special moments in it.,2/4
4216,Camille Claudel,Adjani is possessed in this movie. It is not one of those leisurely costume dramas in which people in beautiful costumes move through elegant rooms. Her eyes always look haunted.,3.5/4

4294,Carmen Jones,"While the embarrassment of talent onscreen is a joy to watch, I can't help be overwhelmed and a little saddened thinking how much of that talent went ignored by Hollywood most of the time.",80/100
4295,Carnage,"The acting comes at full throttle while the pacing cranks up the tension in agonising, incremental degrees.",4/5
4296,Carnage Park,"Carnage Park delivers the thrill-ride such a twisted title suggests, as Mickey Keating's gun-slinging abandon paints the California desert a unique shade of red.",8/10
4297,Carnal Knowledge,"Carnal Knowledge may seem dated, given its 1970s approach to this battle of the sexes. However, it paints a sadly accurate picture of the decidedly vicious attitude of many men to the realm of carnal desire.",82/100
4298,Carol,"""Carol"" is a love story for the ages, a film you feel like you may be walking toward, like Therese does at one point, entranced and lovelorn, forever.",A

4335,Casual Sex?,"This is hardly a film that is going to change anyone's life, but while profundity is not its aim,Casual Sex? has a ring of emotional truth, as it cleverly pokes fun at the crisis-altered. sexual mores of the 1980s.",2.5/5

4349,Catching Out,"A ride worth taking, although the cavalier attitude by the film's subjects regarding their illegal actions is rather disturbing.",3/5
4350,Caterina in the Big City,Caterina Va in Citta has outrageously funny scenes -- but it's a very dark sense of humor. The film is really about personalities.,3.25/4

4377,Celeste and Jesse Forever,"While Celeste And Jesse marks Jones as ready to make the leap from TV to film, it also shows that she maybe shouldn't be her own screenwriter.",C-
4378,Celine: Through The Eyes Of The World,Some concert movies make you feel like you have the best seat in the house; this one plants you squarely in front of the Jumbotron.,2/5

4381,Cellmates,"Cellmates is an indie film that shouldn't work. And at times it doesn't, but at other times it has an offbeat integrity that engages.",2/5
4382,Cellular,"A taut, crowd-pleasing thriller in which the improbable, if canny, premise is overlooked in exchange for what is an exceedingly fun ride.",2.5/4
4383,The Celluloid Closet,"The Celluloid Closet is a first-rate work of cinematic criticism, tracing the ways in which, despite cultural disapproval, gay images, ideas, and implications have slipped into the medium.",A-
4384,Celtic Pride,"The worst concept, execution and end product ever.",1/5
4385,The Cemetery Club,"The movie has a serious undertone, lightened from time to time by scenes that don't quite seem to fit, as if the revisions were designed to lighten the mood... Still, I liked it, partly because of the honesty of the love story.",3/4

4397,Chain Letter,"A severely muddled, amateur offering, the film is a complete waste of time. There's almost pride in the manner the feature highlights Taylor as arguably the most inept director of 2010.",F

4402,Chalk,"Loaded with life, energy, truth and respect.",5/5

4404,Chameleon,It's a character-driven crime film that looks surprisingly polished for a movie with a total budget that was was less than I paid for my last used car.,2.5/4

4413,Changing the Game,Any forced note is counterbalanced by the greater amount of right ones.,3/4
4414,Chaos Theory,"As long as you don't tie your giggle bib on too tight, there's an exquisite depth and unpredictability to Chaos Theory that's wonderful to observe.",A-

4416,Chappaquiddick,"This account of the late senator Ted Kennedy's bad behaviour after his car went off the road and killed his passenger, Mary Joe Kopechne, spends way too much time trying to make us feel sorry for him.",2/5
4417,Chappie,"With its stunning urban landscapes, trash-talking titanium hero and mulleted, God-bothering bad guy (Hugh Jackman, never better), this is hugely entertaining.",4/5

4427,Charlie Countryman,So devoted to conveying the irrational whimsy of new love that it's overly irrational itself.,1.5/5
4428,Charlie Says,What makes Charlie Says so original is its perspective and its willingness to depict the banality and absurdity of life with Manson rather than simply to portray him as the quintessence of evil.,4/5
4429,Charlie St. Cloud,Only marginally suited for a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV episode.,D
4430,Charlie Wilson's War,"The light approach to serious matters (and real-life figures) brings out the irony and absurdity of the situations, but it also trivializes them, and in the end has less impact due to Sorkin and Nichols' neglect of the broader political context.",B+
4431,Charlie's Angels,"Sure, it's easy on the eyes, but would a little brains be too much to ask?",2.5/5
4432,Charlie's Angels,All the feminist virtue-signaling in the world can't conceal the film's creative conservatism.,1.5/4
4433,Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle is merely a preposterous, maximized manipulation of the original film's winning formula.",1/4
4434,Charlotte Gray,An amateurishly-directed war story with one of the most ludicrous finales of any picture of this genre.,2/4

4439,Chasers,Fairly desperate military comedy.,2/5
4440,Chasing Amy,"Hip, clever, and outrageous",4/5

4446,Chasing Papi,[Mendoza] encourages empty frenzy and seems always to put the camera in exactly the wrong place.,2/5
4447,Chasing the Dragon,Chasing the Dragon will be remembered more as a Donnie Yen showcase than a Crippled Ho biopic.,3/5

4454,The Cheap Detective,You don't have to be familiar with Casablanca or The Maltese Falcon to appreciate the humor but it helps. Writer Neil Simon has thoroughly spoofed both classics.,8/10

4479,Chi-Raq,"It's a shattering, thunderous wake-up alarm, a call to lay down arms, a gutsy social satire and a highly stylized work of fiction that sometimes feels as accurate and sobering as the crime reporting you see on the front page of this newspaper.",3.5/4

4496,Children of the Corn 666: Isaac's Return,"No, it only feels like there's been 665 previous entries.",1/5
4497,Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice,"Only the first worthless sequel in a big, long line of 'em.",1/5
4498,Children of the Corn V: Fields of Terror,I wonder if Stephen King chuckles when he finds these movies sitting in the bargain bin.,1/5
4499,Children of the Revolution,Uneven but also unflaggingly lively.,2.5/4
4500,Children of the Sea (Kaijû no Kodomo),It leaves you with the sense that the art form's boundaries have been nudged a little wider as you watched.,5/5
4501,Children Shouldn't Play with Dead Things,"On any absolute scale of movie ratings, it should score pretty low. However, there is no accounting for the amount of fun one can have with it.",5/10
4502,Children Underground,"If you have a stomach for harrowing, depressing true tales of man's inhumanity to man, Children Underground is a fantastic document of a nation's priorities gone wild.",4/4
4503,The Children's Hour,"Well-acted, albeit dated treatment of a then-taboo topic",3/5
4504,Child's Play,"Director Tom Holland falls back on the clichs of the genre: the false alarm, the victim backing into the screen, the child in peril, the lone voice of reason in a wilderness of disbelief.",63/100
4505,Child's Play 2,Entirely standard sequel fare. Fans of the first one will be entertained on an infrequent basis.,2/5
4506,Child's Play,Call it Charlie Brooker's Small Soldiers.,3/5
4507,Child's Play 3,Chucky is as good being bad as ever but the story falls short,2.5/4
4508,Child's Pose,"Gheorghiu, a truly great actress, is here playing the part of a woman who is herself a great actress, and we can't catch either out, and the film goes into its end credits having perfectly preserved this ambivalence.",B
4509,Chill Factor,"The pervasive feel of clock-punching industrial filmmaking at its dreary nadir makes Chill Factor a marginal bargain, even by low seasonal-clearance standards.",2.5/5
4510,Chillerama,An almost astonishingly terrible horror anthology...,1/4
4511,Chimera Strain,"Characterizations make little sense, the pacing is off, and the ending leaves so many more questions than answers.",D+
4512,Chimes at Midnight,A tour-de-force of Wellesian immensity.,4.5/5
4513,China Heavyweight,It stands as a fascinating look at a changing China and the courage it takes for those living there to punch above their weight.,3/4
4514,China Moon,The film's saving grace is in the emotionally impactful performance by Ed Harris.,C+
4515,China Seas,Highly entertaining because of the marvelous cast.,B

4517,Chinatown,You've got to love a film that trusts its audience's intelligence as much as Chinatown does.,91/100
4518,Chinese Box,"I have always been drawn toward stories of exile and expatriation, of people living as strangers in strange lands. I enjoy their bittersweet longing for other places and other friends.",3/4
4519,Fist of Fury (Jing wu men),Not quite up to par with Lee's parting opus . . . but a fitting showcase for Lee's exceptional prowess,4/5

4521,Chinese Zodiac,What a pity this workout doesn't deliver a stronger kick.,2/5
4522,Chipmunk Adventure,Chipmunk Adventure is worth one toked-out viewing for Dody Goodman's gratingly senile Miss Miller and her description of the trio's daily breakfast menu.,3/4

4526,Chloe in the Afternoon (L'amour l'après-midi),One of [Rohmer's] best.,4/5
4527,Chlorine,"Every time Jay Lifton's self-consciously quirky music kicks in, it undermines everything else. It sounds more like Lifton is making fun of indie comedies rather than participating in one.",2/5
4528,Chocolat,"Every character is a cliché, everything about the story is predictably smug.",D
4529,Choke,"One of the few highlights (and acquisitions) of this year's Sundance Fest, Choke is a moderately entertaining black comedy that doesn't fully exploit Palahniuk's absurdist novel about dysfunctional mothers and sons, sexual compulsion and other scams.",B
4530,Choking Man,"If there is finally a point to the film it is that we're all human piatas and that putting sprinkles in your fish soup may not be tasty, but it makes one's upchuck look pretty. I think.",1.5/4
4531,Chooch,"It's an earnest affair that looks like a neighborhood project on film (16-mm, in fact, blown up to 35) for someone's anniversary or birthday party.",1/4
4532,Choose Connor,Has flashes of incredible maturity and complexity [but the filmmaker] still has some things to learn about the basic tenets of storytelling before he can become a quality filmmaker.,B-
4533,Chopper,"Unsettling and at times uneven, but always fascinating material for anyone prepared for a grim ride.",4/5
4534,Chopping Mall (Killbots),Goofball horror flick is salvaged by a quick pace and diverting sense of humor.,3/5
4535,Chopsticks,"Like the inconvenient cutlery it is named after, there's little reason to try it if there are alternatives to be found.",2/5
4536,The Chorus (Les Choristes),"Les choristes isn't great cinema, but it is certainly a crowd-pleaser.",2.5/4
4537,A Chorus Line,"The result may not please purists who want a film record of what they saw on stage, but this is one of the most intelligent and compelling movie musicals in a long time.",3.5/4
4538,"Chris Rock: Kill the Messenger - London, New York, Johannesburg","Whether or not you find this near robotic recitation a good thing or a bad thing for a comic is up to you, but his sheer focus on timing could put any musician to shame.",7/10
4539,Chris & Don,"One of the most positive, affecting portrayals of queer romance in recent memory.",3.5/4
4540,Chris Rock: Bigger & Blacker,One crucial trait that distinguishes [Chris] Rock from every other comedian of his generation is that his jokes proceed from a thought-out political philosophy containing both radical and conservative elements.,B+
4541,Chris Rock: Tamborine,"Tamborine never goes too dark, nor does Rock ever truly blur the line between stand-up set and therapy session...he never loses sight of the comedy - even as he distributes the hard-earned wisdom that comes from regret.",B+
4542,Christine,Carpenter's classic concerning killer cars.,80/100
4543,Christine,"Hall has largely languished with supporting roles in films that in no way prepare you for the breadth she displays in director Antonio Campos's tragic character study, Christine.",5/5
4544,Christmas Carol - The Movie,"A pity the film as a whole could not match Winslet's singing voice, the only ripe plum in an otherwise rum pudding.",2/5
4545,Christmas Eve,"If it's trying in some way to promote focusing on What Really Matters this holiday season, it certainly taught me that I'd rather not waste time on vapid homilies.",1.5/4
4546,Christmas Evil,The film is noted for starting a sub-genre of the jolly St. Nick as a psycho slasher killer.,B
4547,Christmas Inheritance,"While it doesn't stray from the formula, this is a better than average Christmas film thanks to strong performances and overall charming presentation.",8.5/10
4548,Christmas With the Kranks,The movie waffles between competing ideologies while struggling to find humor in characters who overreact to minutia.,2/5
4549,Christopher Robin,"It's impossible to resist all the honey and nostalgia served here. Pooh and the gang will make you reminisce, laugh and cry in this delightful film. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
4550,Chronic,A great performance can't save a sloppy plot.,2/5
4551,Chronically Metropolitan,"Doesn't come together, but I'm not sure if it ever had the chance to, passing on family interplay and bitter reunions to play simplistically with profound emotions.",C
4552,Chronicle,"While it holds onto its 'found footage' conceit a little too eagerly near the end, Chronicle is edgy, intelligent sci-fi, and as is uncommon for the sub-genre, has a strong regard for its characters.",3.5/5
4553,"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe",Nothing short of wondrous!,3.75/4
4554,The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian,"It's still a very entertaining film, although newcomers would be wise to check out Wardrobe if they want to better understand Caspian.",3/5
4555,The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader,There's nothing really special about this latest instalment in the Narnia franchise but it finishes strongly and is worth a look.,B
4556,The Chronicles of Riddick,"Eschewing the claustrophobic minimalism of its predecessor Pitch Black, The Chronicles of Riddick is an extravagant orgy of used sci-fi parts.",1.5/4
4557,Chroniques sexuelles d'une famille d'aujourd'hui (Sexual Chronicles of a French Family),"Most of the camera time goes to airy, awkward sex (no genitalia, though plenty of breasts and backsides), and while it's never titillating, it's also never involving.",2/5
4558,Chrystal,"If the as well-performed, better directed star-filled Levity is worth only 50 screens in its widest release, you'd have to think that Chrystal is headed for similar territory.",3.5/5
4559,Chuck & Buck,It constantly defies expectations.,3.5/4
4560,Chuck Berry: Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll,Does just what the title says--and with great spunk.,3/5
4561,Chuck Close: A Portrait in Progress,The result is a portrait that should interest art-savvy viewers and neophytes alike.,3/4
4562,C.H.U.D. (Chud),Beware of any movie title that tries to be an acronym.,2/5
4563,The Chumscrubber,"Very shrewdly written, its plots and subplots foreshadowing one another and eventually coming together in wonderfully unexpected ways.",B+
4564,Church Ball,"Relies heavily on dumb slapstick, including a few tasteless, low-brow moments.",2/4
4565,Churchill,"As a portrait of the man, it's not only incomplete, but misleading.",2/4
4566,Chutney Popcorn,That really obvious Film School Feeling.,3/5
4567,Ciao,The ever-static camera undercuts the poignantly understated performances with the egotism of a futon ad photographer who fancies Ozu.,2.5/4
4568,Ciao! Manhattan,"At bottom Ciao! Manhattan is cruel exploitation -- though the film is dedicated to Miss Sedgwick's memory, an ultimate indignity.",0/5
4569,Cidade dos Homens (City of Men),Director Paulo Morelli elicits the longing of two teens to discover the identities of their absent fathers as gang wars of their Rio favela close in on them.,B+
4570,The Cider House Rules,"Admirable and enjoyable, highlighted by superb performances.",3/4
4571,The Cincinnati Kid,"Among a cast loaded with talent, McQueen and Robinson are excellent",4.5/5
4572,Cinderella,"When those little mice bust a gut trying to drag that key up hundreds of stairs in order to free Cinderella, I don't care how many Kubrick pictures you've seen, it's still exciting.",3/4
4573,Cinderella,"Such is the affable tone and vivacious, good-natured spirit of this charming piece of cinema, that you are able to look past any flaws, and enjoy this for what it is.",3/5
4574,Cinderella II: Dreams Come True,Do not see this film.,1.5/5
4575,Cinderella III: A Twist in Time,"...all in all, Cinderella III makes a fairly good showing for itself, insofar as these direct-to-video affairs go.",6/10
4576,Cinderella Liberty,"Cinderella Liberty, a movie of enormous good intentions. doesn't work for me because I simply can't believe it.",2/4
4577,Cinderella Man,I found myself completely thrilled by the action.,4/5
4578,A Cinderella Story,"Does justice to its well-known source material while putting a pleasant spin on it. It's better than one may be lead to expect, which is perhaps the best compliment of all.",2.5/4
4579,Cinema Paradiso (Nuovo Cinema Paradiso),"This film is sometimes funny, sometimes joyful, and sometimes poignant, but it's always warm, wonderful, and satisfying.",4/4
4580,Cinema Verite,Best to focus on the real standouts here: the excellence of the casting and performances.,2.5/4
4581,Cinemania,"As a documentary, Cinemania succeeds in making the familiar strange and the unfamiliar everyday.",3/5
4582,Circle,Circle essentially takes a premise that would've been ideal for a 22-minute episode of The Twilight Zone and expands it to a watchable yet erratic 87 minute running time...,2/4
4583,Circle of Iron,"By downplaying the physical and emphasizing the cerebral (or in some cases, the spiritual) Lee was looking to take the genre to another level. For that alone (Circle of Iron) is very important.",3/5
4584,Circo,"A lovely portrait of a small, independent, traditional Mexican family circus that's facing hard times. If the Gran Circo Mexico does eventally fall by the wayside, at least we will have Aaron Schock's captivating, empathetic documentary to memorialize it.",4.5/5
4585,Circumstance,"""Nothing is Private"" would also suit Maryam Keshavarz's feature debut, though she chose ""Circumstance"" [to] reflect the factors surrounding her two young female leads in Iran.",9/10
4586,Circus of Books,"Circus of Books is chock full of entertaining characters, but Karen ultimately emerges as the film's complicated and fascinating heroine.",A
4587,Cirque Du Soleil: Worlds Away,Succeeds as a 3D showcase for Cirque performances far more than it does as a narrative feature film.,3/5
4588,Citadel,"""Citadel"" is definitely a strong exercise in voice and mood, and well worth a look for genre fans.",B
4589,Citizen Duane,An underdog comedy that's neither funny nor poignant nor ingratiating,1/4
4590,Citizen Jane: Battle for the City,The key to this excellent documentary about writer and activist Jane Jacobs in New York City is the way it visually expresses the ideas in her groundbreaking book The Death And Life Of Great American Cities.,5/5
4591,Citizen Kane,"Fifty years after its release, Citizen Kane still seems richer, bolder, more spectacularly alive than any other film of the studio-system era. Regardless of how many times you've seen Orson Welles' 1941 masterpiece, it always feels like the first time.",A
4592,Citizen Koch,If you still don't believe that money drives American politics...,B+
4593,Citizen Ruth,"It's probably too schematic to reward more than a single viewing, but as a provocative one-time surprise it may become a specialized sleeper.",3/4
4594,Citizen Soldier,"It's well edited to create a film that tells the soldiers' story well, and for that, many small sins can be forgiven.",3.5/5
4595,Citizen Verdict,"Scenes seem slapped together and mismatched, performances vary from tight and sardonic to mopey and melodramatic.",2.5/5
4596,Citizen X,Fascinating and absorbing. One of HBO's finest made-for-cable flicks.,5/5
4597,Citizenfour,Poitras delivers a mesmerizing look at both how Snowden managed to release his information as well as why it all matters.,A
4598,City by the Sea,Just can't quite keep its pilot light burning.,1.5/4
4599,City for Conquest,"Uunevenly paced, mounts slowly to a sizzling prizefight sequence, which comes somewhere about the middle, then sags off to a long-drawn, agonized finish.",2/5
4600,City Hall,A watchable but never pulsating portrait of mayoral wheeling-dealing.,2.5/4
4601,City Heat,"One of Mr. Benjamin's main contributions to the film is a good-humored buoyancy, even when things are at their most muddled.",3/5
4602,City Hunter (Sing si lip yan),"Supposedly an adaptation of the popular Japanese animated series, it fails as an adaptation but succeeds as a fun Jackie Chan flick. The fight sequence where Chan becomes characters from the Street Fighter video game are not to be missed.",3/5
4603,City Island,"An indie of the sort that achieved popularity during the 1990s but which has since fallen out of favor, City Island offers jokes worth laughing at and characters who earn their good turns of fortune.",3/4
4604,City Lights,"For anyone familiar with Chaplin's work, his trademark perfectionism is never more evident than in City Lights.",A
4605,City of Angels,"Glossy but with no heart, City of Angels is a smooth, unchallenging bit of fluff, about as romantic as a Hallmark card.",3/10
4606,City of Ember,Fast-paced fantasy has lots of tense moments.,3/5
4607,City of Ghosts,"City of Ghosts is trying so hard to be an epic tale of crime and intrigue, but it just doesn't quite succeed.",3/5
4608,Cidade de Deus (City of God),"The direction is often inspired and sure-handed, even if it's sometimes unfocused or overambitious.",2.5/4
4609,City Of Gold,"This doc is like a loving commentary on the value of immigrants, who have made Los Angeles not just the city of movies but of food as well.",B
4610,City of Industry,"Slight, solemn, borderline silly but watchable.",2/4
4611,City of Joy,"City of Joy seems a little too ""written,"" too conformed to the rituals of Hollywood screenplays. There's so much interesting stuff in the movie we are prepared to forgive that.",3/4
4612,City of Joy,"City Of Joy is, in as far as it goes, a powerful film, reminding viewers that survival itself is something to be proud of and consigning the notion that a raped woman is ruined forever to the dustbin of history.",4/5
4613,City of Life and Death,"Must-see: This multi-dimensional chronicle of the 1937 Japanese occupation and massacre of Nanking is a masterpiece, a devastating war film of epic proportions, shot in a realistic yet also poetic style.",A
4614,The City of Lost Children (La Cité des Enfants Perdus),"The City of Lost Children pushes style to the limit, while occasionally causing substance to lag behind. While the movie sometimes gets so convoluted it's impossible to tell exactly what's going on, it's always fun to watch.",3.5/5
4615,Paura nella città dei morti viventi (City Of The Living Dead) (The Gates of Hell),"Yes, this is the one with the ""intestines scene"".",40/100
4616,City of Women (La città delle donne),"Like a wandering Siddhartha seeking enlightenment, Mastriani pursues his ultimate dream through a vision that can only be created by Fellini.",B
4617,The City of Your Final Destination,The Remains of the Day director has considerable trouble disentangling this latest in his long line of demure chamber pieces.,2/4
4618,City Slickers,One of the flattest cowboy spoofs to mosey on down the trail in a long while.,2/4
4619,City Slickers 2 - The Legend of Curly's Gold,"Like too many sequels, it has forgotten what the first film was really about. Slickers II is about the MacGuffin instead of the characters.",2/4
4620,Civic Duty,"Civic Duty, a thinking person's thriller, is a fascinating Rorschach test for audiences.",3/4
4621,A Civil Action,"All in all, a mediocre fabrication of law-cinema, offering some points of interest, no real action, and a weak ending...",6/10
4622,Civil Brand,Muckraking mess of a movie.,2.5/5
4623,CJ7,"A giddy, childlike enthusiasm dominates every frame of Stephen Chow's film, but unfortunately it's only mildly amusing: Like a hyperactive tyke, CJ7 has a rambunctious energy that ultimately wears you out.",C
4624,The Claim,None of the characters are properly developed.,7/10
4625,Claire in Motion,"Howell and Robinson are certainly savvy when it comes to tackling big, emotional ideas with a light touch, but that doesn't always translate to gripping entertainment. Claire in Slow Motion might be a more fitting title.",C-
4626,Claire of the Moon,"I think this is a movie that needs to be seen because it does speak to topics we've so little opportunity to explore in movies, but ultimately, it may be a movie that you respect more for what it's trying to accomplish than for what it has accomplished.",2.5/5
4627,Claire's Camera (La caméra de Claire),A fun and light experiment that enjoyable because of the presence of Huppert and Kim Min Hee. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
4628,Clambake,"Clambake is indeed awful, but it's amusing and Presley's star power is hard to refute.",2/4
4629,The Clan of the Cave Bear,"The filmmakers made no effort to empathize with their prehistoric characters, to imagine what it might have really been like back then.",1.5/4
4630,Clara,"Working in a kind of cosmic Cameron Crowe mode, writer/director Sherman tries to mix the manic-pixie-dream-girl genre with some considerably weightier themes, placing the elements of his big climactic revelation carefully.",3/5
4631,Clara's Ghost,"The toxicity of family is a limitless goldmine for eager therapists or autobiographical dramaturgists digging for story, but family dysfunction has perhaps never been as amusingly self-skewering as it is in ""Clara's Ghost.""",A-
4632,Clash by Night,The performances are stagy but filled with fiery emotion.,B+
4633,Clash of the Titans,Cynical viewers may begin this laughing at the grandiose acting and the jerkiness of some of the effects. They'll end it by rooting for Perseus and thrilling at his exploits.,3.5/5
4634,Wrath of the Titans,"If even a tenth of the care and attention lavished on the production design and action sequences had been afforded the script, this could have been an adventure of legendary proportions.",2/5
4635,Clash of the Titans,"Though it faithfully follows the original's plotline, Leterrier's slick entertainment is anything but a throwback--just a concession to the Jerry Bruckheimer school of fast, cheap, and out-of-control visual effects.",1.5/4
4636,Class,An unaffecting and derivative movie.,2/5
4637,Class of 1984,"Cheesy, campy, corny, and violent. In other words, a rather fun little B-movie.",3/5
4638,Class of 1999,"Everything about Class Of 1999 screams 1980s, which is no bad thing of course. The fashions, dialogue and soundtrack are almost a perfect snapshot of the era, despite the film being set right at the tail end of the 20th century.",8/10
4639,Class of Nuke 'Em High,"""Better"" than much of Troma's output -- but it's all relative.",2.5/5
4640,Class Rank,"Genial, sweet and old-fashioned teen comedy directed by a John Hughes alumnus",2.5/4
4641,Clay Pigeons,"If serial killers and dead bodies are your idea of laughs, you might get a kick out of Clay Pigeons. Otherwise, you'd be better off skipping this awful black comedy.",2/4
4642,Clean and Sober,"One of the strengths Michael Keaton brings to Clean and Sober is his wild, tumultuous energy, which makes his character seem less like a victim than like an accident causing itself to happen.",3.5/4
4643,"Clean, Shaven","It is a harrowing, exhausting, painful film, and a very good one -- a film that will not appeal to most filmgoers, but will be valued by anyone with a serious interest in schizophrenia or, for that matter, in film.",3.5/4
4644,Cleaner,"Beyond the contributions from Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris, however, there's very little worth talking.",2.5/5
4645,Cleanskin,"Plodding, somewhat misbegotten, and never slick enough to sweep us along.",2/5
4646,Clear and Present Danger,The film seems to have its pulse on some peculiarly modern varieties of madness.,3/4
4647,Clear History,Clear History is so funny it made me want to order up some Palestinian chicken.,3.5/4
4648,The Clearing,"The pleasures of this endeavor, directed with a keen eye for detail by Pieter Jan Brugge, come from what the actors bring to the material.",3/4
4649,Clemency,"Sensitive and hard-hitting, writer-director Chinonye Chukwu's debut feature ""Clemency"" is a thoughtful examination of the death penalty in American prisons - seen from the viewpoint of the people who carry it out.",3.5/4
4650,Cleopatra Jones,"The movie is put together in a sort of disjointed way; there are too many characters, and some of them disappear for so long, we forget them. But that doesn't matter much.",2.5/4
4651,Cleopatra's Second Husband,"Taking a branch off the (early) Neil LaBute tree of filmmaking, Jon Reis has planted a fashionably disturbing offshoot, fertilized with heavy doses of ""Rod-Serlingesque"" irony",2.5/4
4652,Clerks,"Unquestionably uneven, but it is also a very funny wake-up call to the over-the-counter culture.",7/10
4653,Clerks II,"...this is a solid movie with laughs galore, pop-culture references galore, vulgarity and sexual connotations galore and even a cute romance...",8/10
4654,Click,"Based on a cute if simplistic idea, Sandler's special-effects comedy is a cross between Back to the Future and Capra's It's a Wonderful Life, with elements of ""Truman Show"" thrown into the uninspired flick.",C
4655,The Client,"All in all, it's a mixed bag -- but enjoyable enough to please Grisham fans.",2.5/4
4656,Clifford,"Once you've gotten past the gimmick, the film falls short.",D
4657,Clifford's Really Big Movie,There's nothing here for adults and older kids to enjoy.,2/5
4658,Clip,"The film's brutally honest parade of callous behavior and casual, almost cruel sex has a depressing prurience that wears you down.",2/5
4659,Cloak and Dagger,"The last thing we need right now is another movie about a boy caught up in the world of computer games - but ''Cloak and Dagger,'' while fitting that mold, is clever and enjoyable anyhow.",3/5
4660,The Clock,A nice little wartime romance. Garland and Walker are sweet at the young couple in love.,3/5
4661,Clockers,"Although Clockers is, as I suggested, a murder mystery, in solving its murder, it doesn't even begin to find a solution to the system that led to the murder. That is the point.",3.5/4

4663,Clockwise,Overlooked Cleese comedy.,4/5
4664,A Clockwork Orange,"A good movie, but a completely misunderstood one.",4/5
4665,Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"A fairly simplistic plot, which is mostly just a clothesline to string together effective action sequences, eventually runs out of gas and the momentary recapturing of the old thrill fades away.",C+

4667,Close Encounters of the Fifth Kind: Contact has Begun,"Every other sentence out of Greer's mouth begs for a ""Oh give me a BREAK.""",1/4
4668,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a humanistic postmodern masterpiece.,5/5

4670,Close Range,"Once Adkins and Florentine get their engines rumbling, ""Close Range"" manages to deliver some compelling combat sequences, blasting, kicking, and stabbing its way through a southwestern war zone.",B-

4675,Closer To The Moon,Writer-director Nae Caranfil oddly forgoes the abundant elegiac aspects of his film's factual material for a tone approaching the ebullient.,2/4

4678,Cloud Atlas,"Every story, character, and scene in Cloud Atlas commits to a style. That diversity keeps the swirling maelstrom of a movie in check.",4/5
4679,Cloudburst,The feisty actresses clearly relish their vivid roles.,2.5/4
4680,Clouds of Sils Maria,"Slyly, Assayas stages the film with an intentional staginess: even natural conversations have the ring of written dialogue, and he ends every scene with a theatrical fade to black. This is a complex, bewitching and melancholy drama ...",4/5
4681,Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2,"Pretty to look at, but inferior in every other important way.",2/4
4682,Clover,"Things do get extra silly by the end, but the blackly comedic tone is consistent enough to allow for such a wild turn of events to feel at home nonetheless.",B
4683,Cloverfield,"Think Blair Witch meets Godzilla, and since that isn't the first or last time you'll read that comparison, think of a movie that results in something less profound.",2.5/5
4684,Clown,"From its jokey birth as a faux trailer to its unique development into a fully formed picture, ""Clown"" has defied the odds. This is an eerie, auspicious, classily mounted fable of the macabre.",3/4
4685,Clowntergeist,"It's hard to image a movie with this title could be disappointing, but the picture just doesn't bring the clownpocalypse like it should.",D+
4686,ClownTown,"Deathly-dull, but could this no-budget horror film be behind all the scary clown sightings popping up all over the country?",1/4
4687,Club Dread,"Looks like 'The Real Cancun 2: The Machete', an often effective slasher comedy by the 'Super Troopers' guys.",B-
4688,Club Life,"""Club Life"" is a flat, disjointed drama that's buoyed by a couple of good performances. Your mileage may vary depending on your interest in dance montages.",2/5
4689,Club Paradise,"The movie never really comes together, and I think the fault for that begins with Williams. When the star of a movie seems desperate enough to depend on one-liners, can the rest of the cast be blamed for losing confidence in the script?",2/4
4690,Clue,The greatest thing about this movie is the way it brings the game's little details to life.,71/100
4691,Clueless,A candy-colored comedy and an able chaser for any heavy cinematic experiences that have dogged you lately.,B+
4692,Coach Carter,Takes the 'everything-but-the-kitchen-sink' approach. Leaves no sports cliche unturned and no chance for inspirational feel-good moments unvisited.,2/4

4704,Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky,click for the full review,1.5/5
4705,Cocoon: The Return,"The central weakness of Cocoon: the Return is that the film lacks any compelling reason to exist. Yes, it is a heartwarming film. Yes, the performances are wonderful, and, yes, it's great to see these characters back again. But that's about it.",2.5/4
4706,Coda,"There are two good performances here, but sadly not much else to speak of. Patrick Stewart is reliably strong, but it's largely for naught.",2/4
4707,Thick as Thieves (The Code),Don't let the big names fool you: The Code is limp enough a thriller to deserve the direct-to-video treatment it's received.,2/5
4708,Code 46,...wavers between annoying pretentiousness and sheer brilliance.,3/4

4721,Coherence,"If you're into indie sci-fi in the vein of ""Primer"" or ""Another Earth,"" where the thrills up the spine come from ideas rather than visual effects, get a ticket now to see James Byrkit's mindbender ""Coherence.""",3.5/4
4722,Cold Brook,"... Cold Brook succeeds in part by its fantastic cast, but mostly by its focus on simplicity. There're no grand fights or superfluous moments, just a tale of love that transcends time and mortal existence.",4/5
4723,Cold Comes The Night,Twists pile as high as corpses before an overcooked ending sends things spiraling into silliness.,3/5
4724,Cold Creek Manor,"Without a single creative element. Put simply, it's one of the worst films of the year.",1/5
4725,Cold Fish,Is it a black comedy? Is it a horror thriller? More wit and ingenuity might have made it Tarantino-esque.,1/5
4726,Cold in July,Feels like a lost eighties John Carpenter movie- and I mean that in the best way. Don Johnson is stunningly good.,9/10

4734,Cold Turkey,"Even if you don't smoke, you'll find Cold Turkey funny.",4/4
4735,Cold Turkey,"Cold Turkey is well-acted, and at times even well-observed, but about 20 minutes of the material actually matters, and the rest is mere putter.",2/5
4736,Cold War 2,"Cold War 2 is competently plotted, tautly edited and superbly acted across the board. This is a political thriller that deserves the billing.",3.5/5
4737,Cold Weather,"There is a decent story at the center of COLD WEATHER. Unfortunately, it is only about a half-hour long.",5/10
4738,Coldwater,It comes as no surprise that writer-director Vincent Grashaw wrote the first draft of this movie soon after graduating high school.,1/4
4739,Colette,"At first presenting itself as a tightly corseted Big Eyes set during the Belle Époque, Colette erupts into a fun, frothy, and unmistakably feminist biopic.",B
4740,Collaborator,"As the characters drink and drug a long night away, the film turns into a pointed examination of the many masks people don to hide their various grievances and torments.",3/5
4741,Collateral,"A master of grand operatic gestures, Mann's broad-sided portrayals of machismo don't work when confined to a chamber piece.",2.5/4
4742,Collateral Beauty,"Despite the strange direction the plot takes, this is a film that goes with old school traditional values in the vein of movies like Miracle on 34th Street and It's a Wonderful Life...",3.5/5
4743,College Road Trip,College Road Trip plays like an instructional video shown at orientation to ease sheltering parents afraid to let their children leave the nest.,C-

4748,Colonia,"""Colonia"" is not intelligent enough to accumulate any emotional payoff, and it's too generic and unsophisticated in its execution to work purely as popcorn entertainment.",D

4750,Color of Freedom,Forceful and timely stuff.,4/5

4752,The Color of Money,"The Color of Money is a good movie, but perhaps not a good sequel.",3/4
4753,Color of Night,"Color of Night is yet another in a string of vapid, low-tension headaches passing for suspense thrillers that tries to go everywhere and, instead, goes nowhere. At all.",2/5
4754,The Color of Paradise,Visually stunning and emotionally wrenching...an uncommonly graceful and deeply moving portrayal of the hopes and desolation of childhood.,A-
4755,Color Out of Space,"Gorgeous, vibrant, and terrifying, Color Out of Space is packed with Lovecraftian creatures and cosmic infections galore.",3.5/5

4757,Colossal,"Given the bizarro conceit, there's something surprisingly, and frustratingly, safe about the film.",2/5
4758,Color Me Kubrick,"The filmmakers opted for a more episodic structure (with the occasional flashback) and I do have to say that by the end of the 90 minutes, I was growing weary of the shtick.",C
4759,The Comancheros,"Lively and cheerful, but too banal to be a top-rate Curtiz or Wayne film; nevertheless it's a pleasingly entertaining film.",B-

4761,Come And Find Me,Aaron Paul possesses an innate everyman quality that lends itself well to writer-director Zack Whedon's film.,2.5/4
4762,Come As You Are,'Come As You Are' is a feel-good must see for everyone.,4.5/5
4763,"Come Back, Little Sheba",among the best of several booze-obsessed Hollywood melodramas of the 1950s,4/5
4764,Come Back To Me,It's far too predictable and obvious to be truly scary.,2/5
4765,Come Out And Play,"If anything, 'Come Out and Play' is generic to the core, a cut and paste horror thriller that still manages to deliver on both production value and intensity.",3/5
4766,Come See the Paradise,"Come See the Paradise is a fable to remind us of how easily we can surrender our liberties, and how much we need them.",3/4
4767,Come Sunday,The good news is that [Chiwetel] Ejiofor is great even in the scenes that don't go anywhere. Those who find heaven here on earth in the form of strong film performances ought to commune with Come Sunday. The rest can sleep in.,2/5
4768,Come to Daddy,Punctuated by a violent act so cartoonish and bizarre it brings the story back to its strengths.,B+
4769,Come Undone (Cosa voglio di più),"A sensitive anatomy of a sexual affair by Silvio Soldini, one of Italy's most gifted directors.",3/5
4770,Come Undone,A delicately managed piece that is by turns intimately detailed and elliptical.,3/4
4771,Come What May,Christian Carion's film shamelessly wrings excitement from the recreation of violent ideological conflict.,1/4
4772,The Comebacks,"Keep your head down, your expectations low and, maybe, good things will happen. We repeat: Maybe.",0.5/4
4773,Comedian,"At times funny and at other times candidly revealing, it's an intriguing look at two performers who put themselves out there because they love what they do.",8/10
4774,The Comedians,"The movie tries to be serious and politically significant, and succeeds only in being tedious and pompous.",2.5/4
4775,The Comedians of Comedy,"Credit the talent for their skill and timing and ability to riff, but also [credit director] Michael Blieden, who shows that his work on Melvin Comes to Dinner was no fluke.",4/5
4776,Comes A Bright Day,"Aboud summons an impressive array of talent for his debut feature, pitched as an odd mix of indie-Brit parlour farce and Dog Day Afternoon.",3/5
4777,Comes a Horseman,Desperately tries to become monumental in the manner of a John Ford metaphorical Western.,C+
4778,Comet,A star-crossed romance that often feels cosmic and intimate within the span of a single scene.,B+
4779,Comic Book Confidential,The comics themselves are the least interesting part of the movie.,3/5
4780,Comic Book - The Movie,Comic Book reminded me of a DVD bonus item that might be included with a disc's main attraction to help sell the feature.,4/10
4781,Comic-Con: Episode IV - A Fan's Hope,Unquestionably Morgan Spurlock's most entertaining effort since his debut...,3.5/4
4782,Coming Through The Rye,"If you want a film that will put a smile on your face and give you a mountain of inspiration, Rye is about as good as you can get.",9/10
4783,Coming to America,To date the high-water mark for Landis's directorial career and it is the best film Eddie Murphy has ever been in.,6/8
4784,Coming to My Senses,A coming-back-from-paralysis documentary that leaves so many important questions unanswered that it isn't as inspiring as it's meant to be.,2.5/4
4785,Coming Up Roses,"An escalating melodrama in which drug deals, suicide attempts and sexual predation evoke playtime fabrication rather than world-weary experience.",2/5
4786,Commandments,This is one strange movie; it's as if When Harry Met Sally... was directed by Ingmar Bergman.,2/4
4787,Commitment,"In this expansive, even elegant movie, Myung-hoon turns from assassin to knight-errant in pursuit of a virtue he barely has time to understand. His rapid evolution is nothing short of moving.",3/4
4788,Commune,"In its own quiet, revealing fashion, Berman's film explores the folly and faith that characterized much of Black Bear's early existence.",3/4
4789,Compadres,"Great production values, but not as funny as it could be. [Full review in Spanish]",2/5

4791,The Company of Wolves,Neil Jordan's unsettling spin on the old Red Riding Hood themes.,3/5
4792,A Complete History of My Sexual Failures,"Sexual Failures is edited well, the score is great and while certain scenes feel a bit staged, Waitt is immediately likable and a ball to watch on the big screen.",4/5
4793,Complete Unknown,Joshua Marston's latest is an existential drama with big questions that hit harder on the way out of the theater than in it.,B-
4794,Compliance,"As a portrait of what people are willing to accept simply because other people are going along with it, ""Compliance"" is an almost endlessly fascinating study of human behavior, disturbingly unflattering as its conclusions may be.",B+
4795,Compulsion,"Apesar de mostrar a crueldade dos jovens, o filme leva o espectador a torcer contra a pena de morte graas, principalmente, ao forte monlogo de 10 minutos protagonizado por Orson Welles.",5/5

4799,Con Artist,"While we may have learned to properly code our insecurities in the fabric of everyday life, Kastabi is, ironically, in the business of unabashed honesty.",3/4
4800,Con Air,"You'll never mistake it for art, but as far as summer movies go, this is a pretty effective thrill machine.",3.5/4
4801,Conan O'Brien Can't Stop,As solid a showbiz documentary as seen of late when it premiered at SXSW and now works as an addendum to the disastrous Charlie Sheen tour which plays more like the I'm Still Here to Flender's equivalent of the Dixie Chicks' Shut Up and Sing.,3.5/4
4802,Conan the Barbarian,...should appeal to most anyone with a bent for fantasy and swashbuckling derring-do.,7/10
4803,Conan the Barbarian,"The iconic brute Conan the Barbarian is given a reboot, and while performances and set design impress, current filmmaking trends and Marcus Nispel's off putting direction ruin the final product.",2.5/5

4805,Concerning Violence,"A pulsing, echoing trumpet blast-repeated throughout-and some in-your-face political carnage identify Concerning Violence for what it is: a prickly, passionate call to arms.",4/5
4806,Concussion,Concussion is a brilliantly nuanced look at the complications of modern relationships.,3.5/5
4807,Concussion,"A harrowing subject for a film, then, but somehow Landesman - who also wrote the screenplay - never manages to turn it into a gripping movie.",2/5

4812,Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,Rockwell is engaging and wildly funny,3.5/5
4813,Confessions of a Shopaholic,"Vivacious Isla Fisher is appealing but the romance is predictable, editing hyperactive, the compulsiveness done with real wit in Percy Adlon's 'Rosalie Goes Shopping.'",C+

4815,Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen,I was not prepared for the moment when The Tween Who Cried Wolf became The Lindsay Lohan Movie.,1.5/4
4816,Confetti,The characters are well-drawn and superbly acted by the ensemble cast - Webb and Coleman prove particularly good sports by spending almost the entire film naked (and not in a good way),3/5

4823,Conor McGregor: Notorious,"With its slow motion, close-quarters capture of those viscerally violent fights, Notorious makes Raging Bull look like The Champ.",4/5
4824,Conquest Of The Planet Of The Apes,A rather superfluous experience.,2.5/4
4825,Conspiracy Theory,"What makes Conspiracy Theory interesting beyond its cleverness and currency is how the filmmakers manipulate our feelings about its protagonist, Jerry, a New York City cab driver.",4/5
4826,The Constant Gardener,"If this film serves as a model, translation to film should do wonders to enhance le Carr's appeal.",4/5
4827,Constantine,"There may be a special room in Hell for such filmmakers, but it's the audience that suffers the agonies of the damned by having to sit through it.",2/5

4831,Conte d'hiver (A Tale of Winter),"A Rohmer film is a flavor that, once tasted, cannot be mistaken.",4/4
4832,Contempt,Godard fascinatingly wraps the two stories around each other and plays the dark humor very subtly (one of his best comedic touches is having the crassly commercial producer character spout Communistic philosophy).,3.5/4

4834,Contraband,"A solid genre picture that knows exactly what it is, has no delusions of grandeur and carries out its task in entertaining and occasionally even suspenseful fashion.",2.5/4
4835,Contract Killer,A Hong Kong comical martial arts film that works better than expected even if doesn't work.,C+
4836,Contract to Kill,"Overall, he gives the kind of performance traditionally associated with stars who died during filming. And yet, Seagal is in almost every scene.",F
4837,Contracted,"Ultimately disappointing due to an inane script which fashions a thoroughly unlikable, idiotic protagonist who invites derision more than sympathy.",2/5
4838,Contracted: Phase II,It resolves all of the questions you never needed answered. It also follows all of the supporting characters from the first film that you you never needed to learn more about.,1/4
4839,Control,"Corbijn's movie is shot in a stunning high-contrast monochrome, perversely turning Macclesfield's grimness into grandeur. It effortlessly revives a British cinematic style that you might call beautiful realism.",4/5

4843,Coogan's Bluff,New York cop thriller with a touch of the Westerna and a touch of the Eastwood...and all the better for it.,4/5
4844,Cook Off!,"Helped along by talented people, but it simply isn't the laugh riot Michon intends, missing killer punchlines and character focus.",C
4845,"The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover",It's probably safe to say that the British director Peter Greenaway holds the ugliest view of mankind ever put forth by a maker of feature films.,C-
4846,Cookie,"It's the kind of pleasant, sometimes funny, fairly entertaining film that you can never quite remember very well, because even the filmmakers themselves haven't seen it very clearly.",2/4
4847,Cookie's Fortune,Full of local flavor.,C+
4848,The Cookout,"Jerryrigged out of painful stereotypes...so offensive, crude, and dumb that the occasional legitimate satire and good-natured family-values message are effectively negated.",0.5/4
4849,Cool as Ice,At least supermodel Naomi Campbell had sense enough to merely sing under the opening credits rather than try something out of her league.,0/4

4858,Cop Car,"Watching the kids play with guns is always uncomfortable. It's honest though. If kids did this, it would feel fake if they didn't play with the dangerous toys. I feel the film is responsible about it, but rightfully pushes our buttons.",7/10
4859,Cop Land,This overstuffed and shallow film does not come close to meeting any epic aspirations.,2.5/4
4860,Cop Out,"Kevin Smith's take on the interracial buddy-cop movie craps out, leaving Tracy Morgan waiting for the ideal big-screen vehicle and Bruce Willis treading water between the action-hero and character-role phases of his career.",2/5

4884,"Count Yorga, Vampire","Sorry, he's no Dracula, not even a Chris Lee",2/5
4885,Countdown,"[Countdown] also doesn't seem to care about its characters, its premise or any sense of coherence, so there's no reason viewers should, either.",D+
4886,Countdown to Zero,Scarier than anything Freddy Krueger could have dreamed up.,B+
4887,Counterfeiters,Counterfeiters is distinctive enough in its characterization of Bridger and so efficient and engaging in its world-building that its mishandled climax shouldn't weigh so heavily against it.,3.5/5
4888,The Country Bears,"Less Behind-the-Music than After School Special, The Country Bears is thoroughly embarrassing.",1.5/4
4889,Country Strong,"Most of the effort seems to have gone into the original music, which is pleasant but not memorable, and too little on creating believable, multidimensional characters.",2.5/4
4890,"The Aryan Couple, (The Couple)",A minor example of a major genre: the feel-good Holocaust movie.,2/5
4891,Couples Retreat,"To avoid paying for a holiday to hell, don't see Couples Retreat. A prime contender for 2009's Worst Film, this star-studded but startlingly drab ""comedy"" is the kind of terrible trip you pray will be over long before it's time to go home.",1/5
4892,Courage Under Fire,"Courage Under Fire, like the double meaning of its title, is subtle in ways, but is a powerful depiction of the meaning of courage.",3/4
4893,Courageous,"Like a pastor so caught up in the moment that he can't see that the air conditioning has given out and the congregation wants to go home, the film travels far beyond its dramatic climax, aiming for an altar call finale.",1.5/4
4894,Court,"Chaitanya Tamhane's grand canvas is Indian society as represented by its legal system, and what it reveals is none too flattering.",3/4
4895,The Court Jester,The film has a few classic moments.,3.5/5
4896,Cousin Jules,"Approaching his lifestyle with ambivalence, the film still accords Jules enormous respect, showing an almost holy appreciation for the beautiful process of his blacksmithing work.",3.5/4
4897,Cousins,"Cousins is a celebration of carnal desire, wrapped up in a comedy so that nobody is too badly hurt.",3.5/4
4898,The Covenant,"If you've seen the full trailer for The Covenant, well, you've seen just about all this movie has to offer.",2/5
4899,Cover,"Fo shizzle, if it doesn't attain the well-deserved status of a camp classic, only the straight-to-video aesthetic will be to blame.",2/4
4900,The Cowboys,"The scenes along the way of the kids learning to be cowboys are good, warm fun, and it's a shame they had to go for the unlikely, violent, and totally contrived last thirty minutes.",2.5/4
4901,The Wicker Tree,This slack and rather pointless retread is funnier than the original though not at all scary as it trundles towards its predictable conclusion.,2.5/5
4902,Cowboys & Aliens,"Two movies (and two genres) for the price of one, this ultimate popcorn movie of the summer is a mishmash by design, in which Bond meets Han Solo/Indiana Jones, though more effective as Western than sci-fi thriller.",C+
4903,Coyote Lake,Coyote Lake is hardly a shallow enterprise. Its still waters still run pleasurably deep.,3/5
4904,Coyote Ugly,It looks like a big-budget version of a Miller's Genuine Draft commercial.,0.5/5
4905,CQ,"The main story of Paul's struggle to maintain his idealism in the face of a changing world is pretty dull, uninspired stuff.",2.5/5
4906,Crack in the World,"Fico bem realizada que, apesar de datada em vrios aspectos, permanece incmoda e tensa ainda hoje.",4/5
4907,Cracks,"An auspicious debut for Scott, but one whose ingredients are too familiar to really fizz. Green is great, though, in a dark-tinged role that plays to her strengths.",3/5

4909,Cradle of Champions,"Watchable, but Showtime slick and boxing picture predictable.",2.5/4
4910,Cradle Will Rock,A reach exceeding Robbins' grasp.,6/10
4911,The Craft,"With its sense of what can be accomplished on a small budget, The Craft suggests the classic B-horrors of the '40s particularly The Cat People and The Seventh Victim.",3/4
4912,Craigslist Joe,"As hard as he tries, we never truly believe there's a lot at stake for Garner, who seems to cruise through America like a gringo taking a favela tour in Rio.",1/4
4913,Crank,"It revels in its crazed B-movie vibe, and as a result we can't help but enjoy every ludicrous minute.",4/5
4914,Crank 2: High Voltage,Every element comes together to create a piece of gonzo genius we won't soon forget... I dare you not to love every minute of it.,9/10
4915,Crash Pad,"A formula comedy that gets by on sparkling banter and the hilarious ""Sideways"" pairing of Domhnall Gleeson and Thomas Haden Church.",2.5/4
4916,Crave,"Voice-over is always a dangerous prospect, and Crave is a perfect example of why you should think twice before using it, especially if your character's inner monologue isn't really worth listening to.",2/4
4917,Crawford,Modigliani is there from the beginning which helps bring potency and unexpected tragedy to the lives of both Bush's local supporters and his dissenters.,3.5/4
4918,Crawl,"The result is gory and stark, but no Blood Simple.",3/5
4919,Crawl,You want big alligators attacking people? You'll definitely get big alligators attacking the sh-t out of people.,4/5
4920,The Crazies,Outbreak movie that devolves into yet another zombie knockoff.,2/5
4921,Crazy/Beautiful,"If I had to rate it today, it would shoot up from two to three stars.",3/4
4922,Crazy About Tiffany's,Matthew Miele's Crazy About Tiffany's is a bit more compelling than his fatuous 2013 doc Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorf's. But it's still essentially a feature-length commercial for a luxury brand.,2/5
4923,Crazy as Hell,Perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.,3.5/4
4924,Crazy Eyes,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Matching the cold, callused, cynicism of Bret Easton Ellis's LA Gen-X ""Less Than Zero,"" ""Crazy Eyes"" is too much in love with its spoiled brat protagonist. It is still a guilty pleasure in the theater of cruelty.",B-
4925,Crazy Heart,"A richly-realized, deeply-heartfelt character study in the vein of Tender Mercies and Bound for Glory, this sterling directing debut by actor Scott Cooper looks perfectly pitched to finally win Jeff Bridges his very long overdue Best Actor Academy Award.",4/5
4926,Crazy Horse,"For better or worse, audiences of Frederick Wiseman's undisciplined documentary about the Parisian nude review venue the ""Crazy Horse"" will never have to visit the landmark club.",C

4928,Crazy Love,Crazy Love is a rarity in documentaries; it's fun.,4.5/5
4929,Crazy on the Outside,Crazy is just too tame for his own good.,C

4932,"Crazy, Stupid, Love.","With a surprisingly mature screenplay by animation writer Dan Fogelman (Tangled, Cars) and top flight direction from Glenn Ficarra and John Requa Crazy, Stupid, Love cuts to the heart of the matters of the heart.",4.5/5
4933,Creative Control,This is a look at contemporary alienation you won't soon forget.,3/5
4934,Creator,"Creator is ambitious and tries to do a lot of things and does most of them well, but it's a close miss.",2.5/4
4935,Creature,"Chintzy and forgettable ""Alien"" retread.",2/5
4936,Creature,"A nice try, but done in by an annoyingly convoluted script and an obvious dearth of resources.",1.5/4
4937,Creed,"Rousing in spirit, surprisingly emotional and visually dynamic, filmmaker Ryan Coogler's first studio movie is a worthy successor to the 'Rocky' movies.",B
4938,Creed II,"I loved this movie, for so many different reasons...it could have gone so wrong, so cheesy, but instead it turned into something that's a franchise.",4.25/5
4939,Creep,"If producer Jason Blum made the found footage horror movie commonplace in the multiplex, then this is a thankful return to art house strangeness and announces, in Brice, a bold new voice in the horror genre; he's scary good.",B+
4940,Creep 2,"It should be harder to sell this character with such a relatively recognizable actor, and yet you find yourself forgetting who he is in the film's finest moments.",3.5/5
4941,Creeping Flesh,Peter Cushing in a hand-wringing performance is Professor Emmanuel Hildern.,B-
4942,Creepshow,"A darn good horror anthology, which is pretty darn rare.",4/5
4943,Creepshow 2,One of these was more than enough.,2/5
4944,Creepy (Kuripi: Itsuwari no rinjin),"[Kurosawa's] latest, which sees him return to the realm of horror after excursions into more arthouse territory, certainly lives up to its name and has a lot of fun doing so.",B+
4945,Cries and Whispers,"Even though you won't remember significant dialogue, you are certain to retain those agonizing visuals that communicate the agony of a tortured soul.",B+
4946,Crime After Crime,"The film presents a portrait of the incarcerated woman as a determined, optimistic individual who profited from her jail time by helping others to educate themselves.",3/4
4947,Crime & Punishment in Suburbia,"Not faithful enough to be an adaptation, too misguided to be considered an interpretation, and not funny enough to be a parody, this film would do well not to advertise its inspiration. It only makes it look sillier.",4/10
4948,The Crime of Padre Amaro,"Para analizar esta pelcula, es preciso separar dos criterios, el religioso y el cinematogrfico",7.5/10
4949,Crime Spree,The most striking thing one might note about Crime Spree is just how it manages to make so much look bad while adding up to so little.,1/5
4950,Crimes of Passion,Ken Russell's searing drama about life and sex in America.,5/5
4951,Crimes of the Heart,"There are moments when the movie doesn't seem to know where it's going, but for once that's a good thing because the uncertainty almost always ends with some kind of a delightful, weird surprise.",3.5/4
4952,Criminal,The fact that it's all played completely straight only makes it funnier.,1/5
4953,Criminal Activities,Director/co-star Jackie Earle Haley and his cast serve up a solid slice of Tarantino-lite. But the script unravels with weak third act and over-explained finale.,2/4
4954,Criminal Law,"Criminal Law is a textbook example of a movie going wrong before our very eyes, because of the curious failure of the filmmakers to realize that you can toy with an audience only so long before the audience grows resentful.",2/4
4955,Crimson Peak,"Claramente obra de um artista fascinado por histórias de terror e que sente imenso prazer não só em contá-las, mas em concebê-las com carinho ímpar e cuidado admirável com os detalhes.",4/5
4956,The Crimson Pirate,Terrific self-spoofing swashbuckler. Hard to beat,5/5
4957,Crimson Tide,"It's noisy and fun, but that's all it is.",3/5

4959,Criss Cross,All of the elements for a great film noir are here.,3.5/5
4960,Critical Care,"The film is a stimulating mix of a medical drama and a courtroom showdown, with broad comedy from Brooks, a little sexual blackmail, and a touching subplot involving another terminally ill patient who thinks he is being visited by the devil.",3/4
4961,Critical Thinking,"Leguizamo goes with the flow and pokes fun at the ""corniness"" of it all. He immerses the viewer into being a member of the class - fully aware that he could lose your interest at any slip.",4/5
4962,Critters,What makes Critters more than a ripoff are its humor and its sense of style. This is a movie made by people who must have had fun making it.,3/4
4963,Critters 2: The Main Course,"It lacks all of the style and sense of fun of the original Critters and has no reason for existence -- aside, of course, from the fact that Critters is a brand name and this is the current model.",1/4
4964,Critters 3,Three times stupider than its pair of predecessors - and they were pretty stupid.,1.5/5
4965,Critters Attack!,"Despite its many flaws, it's mildly entertaining.",B-
4966,"Crna macka, beli macor (Black Cat, White Cat)","Bosnian-born writer-director Emir Kusturica makes raucous films so visually dense they overwhelm. But his characters, freakish or treacherous, come up wonderfully human.",3/4
4967,Crocodile Dundee,"The movie feels curiously machine-made, as if they had all the right ingredients and simply forgot to add the animal magnetism.",2/4
4968,Crocodile Dundee II,Absolutely no charm to the film,2/5
4969,Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles,Of little interest even for its targeted PG market,2/4
4970,Cromwell,"Richard Harris, as Cromwell, schleps around the kingdom reciting epigrams and looking distracted. He doesn't inhabit the role or even seem to care much about it.",2/4
4971,Crónicas,An honest effort that is too dramatically slack to sustain more than average interest.,2.5/5
4972,Cronos,A viewer willing to overlook its lack of heart will be rewarded by a project full of a new director's excitement at being allowed to realize his vision.,7/10
4973,Crooked Arrows,The story is unique and engaging enough to transcend the uplifting sports-underdog formula.,2.5/4
4974,Crooked House,Gilles Paquet-Brenner's film is ultimately a genre item that operates on alternately prestigious and campy autopilot.,1.5/4
4975,Crooklyn,"Crooklyn is not in any way an angry film. But thinking about the difference between its world and ours can make you angry, and I think that was one of Lee's purposes here.",3.5/4
4976,Cropsey,The portentous narration and manipulative horror-film aesthetics turn what might have been a portrait of a boogeyman myth's lingering societal role into merely a crude episode of 48 Hours.,2/4
4977,Cross Creek,"Somehow, Mr. Ritt manages to use this very artificiality in the service of an optimism that is very much his own.",3/5
4978,Cross of Iron,"Peckinpah indulges in endless combat scenes (this was his only war movie), which try the patience of viewers who came for the real story.",3/5
4979,Crossfire,It would have been a much better film if it weren't for the censor: there is absolutely no question about that.,C+
4980,Crossfire Trail,Some westerns are destined to be classics. Some were meant to be TNT originals....,2/5
4981,Crossing Delancey,Crossing Delancey makes the mistake of creating characters who are interesting enough to make us care for them -- and then denying them freedom of speech.,2.5/4
4982,The Crossing Guard,"though Penn doesn't always seem to know where he's going, his movie doesn't altogether miss its destination.",3/4
4983,Crossing Over,The best you can say is that Kramer is ambitious enough to present the problem. Yet he's too unsophisticated to tear off any painful societal scabs or materially add to the debate.,2/5
4984,Crossing the Line,"Amazingly, director Daniel Gordon and his crew were allowed to film Dresnok in and around his home in Pyongyang, resulting in a canny portrait of a man as uniquely fit for a life on display as he is blindly willing to kowtow to power.",4/6
4985,Crossover,"Just as streetball is a pale version of college or NBA basketball, so too is Crossover a pathetic imitation of an emotionally engaging, professionally made movie.",0.5/4
4986,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Coolly elegant, slyly humorous and visually breathtaking... If there's such a thing as inspired silliness, this picture surely embodies it.",A-
4987,The Crow,"The Crow allows no room for the viewer to take a breath, as it blazes with breakneck speed from scene to scene.",3/4
4988,The Crow - Salvation,"Plenty of bad dialogue, zero originality or depth.",4/10
4989,The Crow: City of Angels,"Suffice to say, when people think of the moribund, brooding Eric Draven, they think of Brandon Lee, and this sequel isn't going to change that one iota.",2.5/5
4990,Crown and Anchor,"While you can pretty much tell where Crown And Anchor is going from the first scenes, it plays out with power and purpose.",3/5
4991,Crown Heights,Too crammed and hectic to convey the immensity of the systemic evils that run through its ruptured heart.,C-
4992,Crown Vic,"Joel Souza hasn't reinvented the wheel with Crown Vic, but he has definitely sent it down a different road.",9/10
4993,CRSHD,CRSHD may appeal to younger viewers more so than it will with older audiences.,3/5
4994,Cruel Intentions,Kumble's attempt to mine anguish of tragic proportions becomes no more than a display of sappy melodrama.,6/10
4995,Cruel Intentions 2,"if he intended to produce a straightforward two-hour original prequel, the writer-director would have made certain that the script was less meandering.",2.5/5
4996,The Cruise,"I get letters from people who would like to make a movie. My advice could be, find a subject like Speed Levitch and follow him around with a video camera. That's what Bennett Miller did -- directing, producing and photographing The Cruise.",3/4
4997,Cruise,"Melodramatic car culture summer romance, a laugh-free ""American Graffiti"" set in 1980s Queens.",1.5/4
4998,Cruising,"It's a movie with a vast undercurrent of restlessness, of people looking for a satiating experience, looking anywhere, everywhere.",4/4
4999,Crumb,"Rarely has there ever been a work as great as Crumb, an achievement resting on both Zwigoff's talent and grace and on the enigma and poetry of its subject.",4/4
5000,Crush The Skull,Nguyen shows great promise with Crush the Skull as he keenly identifies here what genre fans enjoy so much about horror movies & finds clever ways to manipulate those tropes into an experience that's as funny & quirky as it is manic & tense.,4/5
5001,Crusoe,"Beautifully filmed, but suffers from deliberate pacing and a shallow, uninspired viewpoint.",2.5/4
5002,Cry-Baby,"Some of the musical numbers are fun and there are some good gags here and there, but for the most part this one is pretty weak.",2/4
5003,Cry Freedom,"For the first half of this movie... Interesting things were happening, the performances were good and it is always absorbing to see how other people live. Most of the second half of the movie, alas, is taken up with routine clock-and-dagger stuff.",2.5/4
5004,Evil Angels (A Cry in the Dark),"Streep's performance is risky, and masterful.",3/4
5005,Cry of the Owl,"Overall, it's the kind of technically proficient, deliberately paced, grim sleepwalk that leaves one cold rather than cracked open.",2.5/5
5006,Cry_Wolf,"Une version un peu + intelligente du slasher movie habituel, ce qui n'en fait pas + un film intressant.",2/5
5007,The Crying Game,"A touching portrait of two lonely, displaced people reaching out to one another across the void.",4/5
5008,Crypto,"Rarely do I advocate seeing a movie at home over the full theater experience, but Crypto is the exception.",3/4
5009,Crystal Fairy,Crystal Fairy is an acid trip where the frequent bonhomie is doused by sobering introspection.,3/5
5010,CSA: The Confederate States of America,"The idea behind the film is such a good one that I wish a more talented filmmaker than Kevin Willmott, and one with better resources, had come up with it.",C+
5011,CSNY Déjà Vu,An exceptional rockumentary which features riveting political debate and good tunes.,4/5
5012,Cthulhu,"Cthulhu isn't awful, but it isn't particularly compelling either, as Glidark and Cogswell make their message so plain that it robs the story of its broader mysteries.",2/5
5013,Cub (Welp),"Welp, indeed.",0.5/4
5014,Cuba And The Cameraman,"The film's lifeblood can be found in its connective tissue, as Alpert continually revisits the same memorable assortment of Cuban peasants and city folk.",B+
5015,Cuban Fury,"If Billy Elliot was about a passion nurtured from a young age, Cuban Fury is what happens when that unlikely passion for movement is lost, and found. It's as sweet and charming as its cast.",3.5/5
5016,Cubby,"[Mark] Blane tells the story of a man whose life is a mess without turning his film into a mess in the process, and that's trickier than it looks.",3/5
5017,Cube,Surprisingly gripping.,3.5/5
5018,Cube 2 - Hypercube,"A highly intriguing thriller, coupled with some ingenious plot devices and some lavishly built settings..it's a worthwhile tutorial in quantum physics and slash-dash",3/5
5019,Cuck,Cuck is a hard watch but [Rob] Lambert's willingness to look directly at a social phenomenon frequently trivialised or abstracted from the human does him credit.,3.5/5
5020,Cujo,This one's got some bite.,3.5/5
5021,Cult of Chucky,"Cult of Chucky takes the franchise to its (psycho!)logical conclusion. There is daffy, orange Easter eggs aplenty and enough blood to entertain the (as yet) uninitiated.",7/10
5022,Cunningham,"The alternately delightful and harrowing Cunningham homes in on the most urgent period in Merce Cunningham's dance-making career, which spanned seven decades.",4/5
5023,Cupcakes,"Charming, cheerful and plain good fun, Cupcakes is an uplifting and visually arresting musical comedy, but the performances are stiff and the final build-up is disappointingly underwhelming.",3/5
5024,Curdled,"For a black comedy, a little too heavy on the 'black' and too light on the 'comedy.'",2/4
5025,The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"Brad Pitt gives an Oscar-caliber turn in this lyrical tale, which bears resemblance in structure and style to Forrest Gump (both penned by Eric Roth), but its storytelling is too leisurely paced, and director Fincher indulges in too many excesses.",B
5026,Curly Sue,"Curly Sue is a cornball, soupy, syrupy, sentimental exercise in audience manipulation, but that's the good news, because this is a movie that works.",3/4
5027,Curse of Chucky,'Curse of Chucky' [is] alarmingly good...Chucky fans should rejoice as [it] is clearly going to re-ignite the franchise for years to come. Chucky has never looked better...,4/5

5075,Dallas Buyers Club,"The fireworks caused by pitting never-say-die Texas bravado against heartlessness is a powerful mix, and the film manages to be an inspiring tale amidst all this sadness.",8.5/10
5076,Damage,"Stephen and Anna are wrong to do what they do in Damage, but they cannot help themselves. We know they are careening toward disaster. We cannot look away.",4/4
5077,Damascus Cover,The only thing anyone will remember about Damascus Cover is that it marks the final on-screen appearance of the now deceased tremendous actor John Hurt,1/5
5078,Dames,"The most Berkeleyesque of all [his films], for all the good and bad that entails.",2.5/5

5084,Damsels in Distress,One is likely to leave Stillman's movie feeling somewhat disenchanted that it only partially delivers on the long wait for his return.,6/10
5085,Dan in Real Life,"The plot tickles sitcom, but the film is a winner because Carell and Binoche follow Hedges' lead and keep it real. Sharing their company really is a pleasure.",3/4
5086,Dance Academy: The Comeback,"In the final stanza of ""Dance Academy"" it finally becomes the movie that you're hoping it will be; it's a crowd pleaser that has surprises up its sleeve.",3/5
5087,Dance Flick,...hilarity is supposed to ensue. But it really just doesn't.,D+
5088,"Dance, Girl, Dance","Arguably Dorothy Arzner's most personal film, this chronicle of female friendship is an anomaly: a feminist film made before feminism existed, directed by Hollywood's only female director, and a buddy picture before the genre was invented.",B+
5089,Dance Me Outside,"Such an odd start gives one hope. But, sadly, nothing as imaginative happens again.",1/4
5090,Dance with Me,"It comes alive periodically but spends way too much time with low-grade soap opera material. Say what you will about the film, its two stars are charming.",2/4

5099,Dancing In Jaffa,"The initially reluctant, moving duets they finally perform make you feel like, yes, dancing.",3/5
5100,Danger Close,"Danger Close fetes veterans less than it does Quade, who gets to talk herself up, often in an unseemly manner, coming across as braggadocios about her own bravery even as she pays lip service to the solemnity of her job.",3/10
5101,Danger Close,Danger Close stays true to Australian sacrifice but walks a perilous line between honour and amnesia.,2/5
5102,Danger: Diabolik,Pulpy late-60's spy silliness.,2/5
5103,Dangerous Beauty,a fancy bodice-ripper with a political message,C
5104,Dangerous Ishhq,"Ms. Kapoor and Mr. Duggall don't have much chemistry, and the film is too silly to have any emotional traction. In Hindi cinema, that's unforgivable.",2/5

5106,Dangerous Lies (Windfall),"Uninspired woman-in-jeopardy story has violence, swearing.",2/5

5108,Dangerous Minds,"There's not enough backstory for or insight into any of the characters, which keeps them at an emotional distance.",2.5/5
5109,A Dangerous Woman,The movie centered around Winger's sexuality. She gave an absolutely wonderful performance. Very realistic. I wish she had a better director.,2/4
5110,Daniel,"The movie tries to encompass too much. It devotes so much time to the past, to the children's childhoods, that the present-day scenes are slighted.",2.5/4
5111,Daniel & Ana,"The director effusively fixates on the siblings' post-traumatic stress, conveyed throughout fancily composed and classically scored scenes that suggest parodies of Michelangelo Antoninoi's ennui-clogged style.",1/4
5112,Daniel Isn't Real,"Daniel Isn't Real is a psychological thriller married with cosmic body horror in inventive, original, and exciting ways.",4/5
5113,Danika,Upsetting that it had to go for the easy genre closer instead of exploring the universal parental mentality that Danika had going for it until the final half-hour.,2.5/4
5114,Danny Collins,"A cast of old pros (Christopher Plummer, Annette Bening, Bobby Cannavale, Jennifer Garner) and a touching final scene elevate the material just enough to redeem it.",B-
5115,Danny Deckchair,"It's a shame that Danny's awakening to happiness is weaved into a fabric of deception, since it means we'll have to suffer the trite dismantling of his newfound life",2/4
5116,Danny Says,"A hagiography that makes you feel a lot was left unsaid, that Danny Fields was everything he says he was -- and more, and just possibly, less.",2.5/4

5121,Daredevil,It looks like Marvel's invasion of the 21st Century will continue for quite some time.,3/5
5122,The Darjeeling Limited,"Going to India and working with 2 writers do little to reenergize Anderson because he imposes the same themes (broken families, lost souls), self-conscious approach and seriocomic sensibility on the new feature, further confined by being set on a train.",C+
5123,Dark Shadows,"[Burton's] co-conspirators Depp, Bonham Carter, and the shaman that renders them all ageless have returned to wreak scenery-eating havoc once again, but the resulting concoction is significantly more delectable than anything they've conjured in some time.",4/5
5124,Dark Blue,"Quite watchable and occasionally electric, but its deeper intentions remain submerged, struggling against cop movie clichés that even an average episode of Law and Order manages to avoid.",3/5
5125,Dark Blue World,"You might remember the film's plot and character archetypes from Pearl Harbor, although Michael Bay's war turkey, in retrospect, lends itself to camp revisionism.",1/4
5126,Dark City,"Proyas has expanded his abilities on Dark City, and has created a film that is much more ambiguous and full of more thought.",3.5/4

5132,Entre tinieblas (Dark Habits) (Dark Hideout),far drearier and lifeless than Almodvar's best films,C-

5139,Dark Phoenix,A missable culmination to the 20-year X-Men franchise thus far.,2/5
5140,Dark Places,French director Gilles Paquet-Brenner does a valued job making the long and morbid novel into a 2 hour movie while staying true to the book. [full review in Spanish],3/4
5141,Dark River,The rugged emotional territory (and the Yorkshire accents) prove heavy-going in an uncompromising film that elicits a lot more admiration than enjoyment.,3/4
5142,Dark Signal,"Dark Signal is ambitious and plays its horror and mystery dead straight, a refreshing approach that proves just how sincere Evers-Swindel is about his first film.",8/10
5143,Dark Skies,"Nicely shot and editing, modestly chilling, but missing the panic and fear real parents would feel for kids in jeopardy.",2/4
5144,Dark Summer,"The cacophony of visions, broken mirrors, and mutilations only points to the ghost in the machine respecting The Craft as its spirit animal.",1.5/4
5145,Dark Tide,"An eternal morass of dreary conversations, paper-thin character development, and plot convolutions that were old hat by the time Jaws 2 showed up.",1.5/5
5146,Dark Touch,Dark Touch seems to reside almost completely in a realm of fantasy that isn't Neve's own and borders perilously and atonally on camp.,2/4
5147,Dark Victory,"a soap opera, yes, but a pretty fine one",3/5
5148,Dark Was The Night,Dark Was The Night is an effortless monster flick that features a strong enough performance from Kevin Durand to turn something so dimly average into a creature flick with a bit more investment.,6/10
5149,Dark Water,A classy ghost story is just the ticket in a summer of crass jolts.,3/4
5150,Dark Waters,"While ""Dark Waters"" chronicles the evolution of an activist, its most effective moment comes with a closing implication that its story has just begun.",B-
5151,Darkest Hour,"Few would argue that Gary Oldman isn't one of the finest actors of his generation, but this is a tour de force portrayal that will define his body of work for decades to come.",B+
5152,Darkman,"It comes on exceptionally strong, sure of itself and its basic, primitive hold on the audience.",5/5
5153,Darkman II: The Return of Durant,"Horrible sequel, even for straight-to-video fare. Why would Durant be a big villain? He was a henchman. Darkman III was a tad better, but both sequels lack the Raimi touch.",0/5

5160,Darling Companion,A lost-dog drama so insufferable it makes one wish its human characters would also run off and never return.,0.5/4
5161,Darling Lili,"if you thought The Sound of Music was hokey, wait'll you get a load of this",1.5/5
5162,D.A.R.Y.L.,Do guilty pleasures get any more guilty or any more pleasurable,3.5/5
5163,Das finstere Tal (The Dark Valley),"Centered on an uninvolving hero, and proceeding in unsurprising ways, the film's cinematographic competence can't compensate for an overwhelming sense of ""ok, and?"" to the whole endeavor.",C
5164,Das Versprechen (The Promise),"Although it has many a tragic scene, the ultimate message made me feel like I had just heard Beethoven's Ode to Joy being sung - very uplifting.",3.5/4
5165,Date And Switch,The film's forced quirkiness and repeated displays of bro-ism in action hinder the potential for a more subtle approach to the potentially challenging issue the story depicts.,2.5/4
5166,Date Night,"Date Night is held together by a terrific cast that make a little go a long, long way. Somewhere in all of this there was a seriously good movie. As it is, we have a seriously weird one.",3/5
5167,Date with an Angel,"This movie ought to be shot. It wastes not only the idea of the angel, but also the human presence of Cates, a bright and quick actress who is required to play a simpering bimbo.",1/4
5168,American Experience,The emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who's ever had family trauma.,B+
5169,Daughter of the Wolf,"Gina Carano, Dreyfuss and Brendan Fehr acquit themselves admirably, but there's no saving this script.",1.5/4

5171,Daughters of the Sexual Revolution: The Untold Story of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders,"This slickly edited documentary features stunning archival footage and new interviews with many key cheerleaders from 1972-1990, but the core revelations here come from Mitchell's interview footage.",B
5172,Dave,Pulls off the impressive feat of blending old-fashioned romance with gentle comedy and a sprinkling of modern satire.,4/5
5173,Dave Chappelle: Sticks & Stones,"Sticks & Stones is terrible, and [Dave] Chappelle can only blame himself for that.",3/10
5174,David and Bathsheba,"Stale, earnest, and dignified (like most of Henry King films), this Biblical saga primarily served as star vehicle for Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward.",C
5175,David & Layla,"Though it's no Romeo and Juliet, David & Layla is an offbeat cross-cultural romance with a positive message.",3/5
5176,David and Lisa,"It's not a bad time, but it's talky and more than a little pedantic. And Dullea looks like the oldest teen on earth.",2.5/5
5177,David Cross: Making America Great Again,"Alternating angrily articulate ranting with writerly, well-crafted punchlines, Cross works his audience over relentlessly.",B+
5178,"Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier","Feature version of three TV Disney episodes still fun, exciting",5/5
5179,Dawn of the Dead,"Doesn't stop to take its breath, and it remains frequently scary in the moment without leaving much to chew on afterwards.",2/4
5180,Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes,"This groundbreaking, challenging and immensely rewarding sequel offers audiences a veritable feast consisting of mature science-fiction themes, complex emotional performances (both human and digital), and riveting combat set pieces.",4/5
5181,Dawn Patrol,"The opposite of enlightenment, the film hides its anxieties behind a mlange of third-rate grit and playful xenophobia.",1/4
5182,The Day After Tomorrow,"Mother Nature is a *****, but another Ice Age would at least put sermonizing blockbuster filmmaking like this on deep freeze.",2/4
5183,A Day at the Races,Sublime.,5/5

5185,Day Night Day Night,"Like United 93, Day Night Day Night exploits our post-9/11 anxieties.",2/4
5186,Day of the Dead: Bloodline,"Bloodline can't figure out its message, and the characters are nowhere near interesting enough to overcome the muddled themes of the film",1.5/4
5187,Day of the Falcon,"Banderas hams and Pinto flutters. If it weren't for Strong and some colourful art direction, you could chalk this up as a busted well.",2/5
5188,Day of the Flowers,"It's a likeable film, if not a particularly riveting one, easily enjoyed and just as easily forgotten.",3/5
5189,The Day of the Jackal,Very exciting and entertaining.,10/10
5190,The Day of the Locust,"A fascinating, if flawed, example of the film industry turning the lights on itself and finding nothing there but darkness.",4/5
5191,Day of the Outlaw,It's a beaut.,B+
5192,The Day the Earth Stood Still,"The original 1951 film carried a timely anti-nuclear message, but this film wouldn't dare offend anyone by even mentioning the phrase ""global warming.""",1.5/5
5193,Day Watch,"Aside from one stunning image of a sports car skidding along the face of a curved high-rise hotel, Night Watch fails to even equal its forebear's handful of flashy CG moments.",1.5/4
5194,Day Zero,"This is not a watered-down take on what would happen if the men we know got drafted--it aims for the jugular. And hits it, hard.",4/5
5195,Daybreakers,...an exciting (albeit slightly uneven) addition to the vampire-movie canon.,3/4
5196,Daydream Nation,"Before it completely wears out its welcome, Daydream Nation basically comes off as a watchable teen drama.",2/4
5197,Daylight,The story has classic disaster-film simplicity - nothing taxing here.,2.5/4
5198,Daylight,"Perpetually torn between its philosophical ambitions and horror-film roots, Daylight suffers from a debilitating identity crisis.",2/4
5199,Daylight Robbery,"While nicely acted and never less than watchable, Daylight Robbery is ultimately disappointing thanks to unsympathetic characters, some dodgy direction and a stifling lack of tension.",2/5
5200,Giorni e Nuvole (Days and Clouds),"Sensitive and subtle, it sympathetically details the devastation of economic insecurity and the regeneration of a marriage.",7/10
5201,Days and Nights,"A Chekhov modernization/adaptation that doesn't quite come off, despite a generally accomplished cast.",2/4
5202,Days of Glory,"Bouchareb's WWII epic took more than a decade to make, but dealing with racism and injustice within the French army, is at once an impressive chronicle of a nearly-forgotten unit and a timely statement vis-a-vis the recent racial riots in France.",B+
5203,Days of Grace,"This is genre filmmaking taken to its pulpiest extreme, an example of style over substance to be sure, but what style.",4/5
5204,Days of Heaven,"One thing that certainly can be said about Terrence Malick's Days of Heaven: it's not sentimental or manipulative. Unfortunately, it's also not particularly involving.",2.5/4
5205,Days of Thunder,"There's no sin in a movie that's just flat-out entertainment, but with some care this movie could have been much better -- instead of just aspiring to be better.",2.5/4
5206,The Daytrippers,"After an hour and a quarter of dead pan humor that only works in fits and spurts, the film finally comes alive in the last ten minutes.",2/4
5207,Dazed and Confused,"Once every decade or so, a movie captures the hormone-drenched, fashion- crazed, pop-song-driven rituals of American youth culture with such loving authenticity that it comes to seem a kind of anthem.",A
5208,D.C. Cab,Thus beginning the career of director Joel Schumacher...,2/5
5209,DCU: Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox,"Years from now it may be looked at as the animated film that took the direct to video comic book movie market to another level of storytelling possibilities. Yes, it's that good.",9.5/10
5210,Ddongpari (Breathless),Impressive first effort by the writer/director/producer/star this downbeat drama is sincere and authentic.,3/5
5211,De rouille et d'os (Rust and Bone),"These are two towering performances in a film of genuine power. Rust and Bone may not be for everyone; but it's a complex, assured, demanding work.",4/5
5212,De Sade,"Essentially the film is Caligula set 1700 years later, complete with washed-out photography and no-name actresses willing to show off their, ahem, talents.",2.5/5
5213,De zaak Alzheimer (The Memory of a Killer),"There isn't a single original thought recognizable in the dim bulb The Memory of a Killer's empty, imitative head.",1.5/4
5214,Dead Man Running,"It has a quality cast, but we've run round this track too many times, while the script jogs from scene to scene without any surprises.",2/5
5215,Dylan Dog: Dead of Night,While it has its charms -- due mostly to the chemistry between Routh and Huntington -- Dylan Dog: Dead of Night ultimately plays like a lesser episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.,2.5/5
5216,Dead or Alive: Hanzaisha,Director Takashi Miike finds an odd sense of ungallant destiny residing within his archetypal characters.,B+
5217,Dead Again,"The movie isn't just unpretentious; it's garishly, thrillingly vulgar.",A
5218,Dead Alive,"Horror films used to be primordial spook shows, tapping midnight-dark fears. Now they tap bodily goo: rivers of blood, dripping limbs, eyeballs that go pop in the night.",B
5219,Dead and Buried,Seriously creepy and inventive little thriller. Check it out!,3.5/5
5220,Dead Ant,"The sort of film you really want to see with an audience after everyone has had a few beers, Dead Ant makes up for what it lacks in finesse with spirit and energy.",3/5

5223,Dead Calm,"This is not a gimmick film ... and Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.",3/4
5224,Dead Dicks,"Dead Dicks is a difficult film to recommend to a general audience. It will be hard going for many, and for those who have suffered on both sides of a mental health problem, it's an emotional watch.",8/10
5225,Dead End,"Intelligent, generally effective film version of the Kingsley play.",4/5
5226,Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round,Serviceable film best known for the film debut of Harrison Ford as the bell hop!,3/5

5231,Dead Man on Campus,"This film is unendurable, but aside from that, it's also troubling.",1/4
5232,Dead Man's Burden,You never get over the feeling that you're watching modern actors play frontier-drama dress-up. It's a deathblow.,3/5
5233,Dead Man's Shoes,Shane Meadows delivers a tale that's as grimly satisfying as it is sadly insightful.,4/5
5234,Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid,This is Carl Reiner's cleverly adapted spoof on noir films of the post-World War 11 days.,C
5235,Dead Night,The movie oozes eerie atmosphere and sinks its teeth into you.,3/4
5236,Dead of Night (Deathdream),"Like the best genre films, Deathdream offers an interesting glimpse of the American psyche during the time it was made.",7/10
5237,Dead of Winter,"The movie itself is finally just an exercise in silliness -- great effort to little avail -- but the actors have fun with it, the sets work and there are one or two moments with perfect surprises.",2.5/4

5239,Dead Poets Society,"The best stories and performances, one of the greatest films of the 1980s and a rare classic that should be treasured.",5/5
5240,The Dead Pool,"The best thing about The Dead Pool is the best thing about almost all of Clint Eastwood's movies: The film is smart, quick, and made with real wit. It's never just a crude action movie, bludgeoning us with violence.",3.5/4
5241,Dead Ringer,"Solidly crafted, but uninspired and tepid thriller with Bette not at her best.",3/5
5242,Dead Ringers,"The kind of movie where you ask people how they liked it, and they say, 'Well, it was well made,' and then they wince.",2.5/4

5266,Dear Heart,A pleasant offbeat romantic comedy about middle-aged opposites making a love connection against all odds.,B-
5267,Dear Jesse,"Thoughtful, personal examination of the dichotomy of North Carolina as a bizarre mix of the tolerant and the intolerant, the progressive and the reactionary.",4/5
5268,Dear John,"Awash in mawkish sentimentality, Dear John still will move you deeply - if you're a 12-year-old girl.",2/5
5269,Dear Mr. Watterson,"The film will send a viewer scrambling for their lovingly battered old copies of ""Yukon Ho!"" or ""Something Under the Bed is Drooling.""",3.5/4
5270,Dear Wendy,"Von Trier and Vinterberg can't help but hammer the firearm debate on every nail they can find and when they run out, the search begins for fingers",3/4
5271,Dear White People,"Simien's script is at its funniest when at its most confrontational, touching on a number of keen, pointed observations on the subtleties of racism.",3/5
5272,Death and the Maiden,"The more serious problem here is Polanski's decision to keep the film housebound, using only camera movements to break things up. The result is a stilted, claustrophobic effect.",2.5/4
5273,Death at a Funeral,"Funerals can be fun is the point made by this British comedy, a Feydeau-like farce brimming with brio, one that travels beautifully across the Atlantic.",B+
5274,Death at a Funeral,"Nude, hallucinogen-fueled jaunts on rooftops, revelations about same-sex relationships -- with a little person, no less -- and individuals covered in feces are all executed with verve by the typically misanthropic Neil LaBute.",3/5
5275,Death Becomes Her,"The end result, though, is a film that tries to do too many things at once and does none of them quite right.",2.5/5
5276,Death by China,As a wake-up call... Navarro scores points.,2.5/4
5277,Death Defying Acts,"As a slight and visually arresting little ""what if?"" tale, one that centers on a pop culture icon who still fascinates us today, Death Defying Acts is a perfectly passable period piece.",3.5/5
5278,Death House,"This strange, ambitious genre movie is notable for its huge cast of horror icons from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, but it's more horrifying than scary and not always good, though certainly interesting.",3/5
5279,Death Line (Raw Meat),Death Line is an effectively creepy low-budget horror film made with heart and wit.,8/10
5280,Death Note,"Dafoe absolutely devours the role and chews the surrounding scenery, but he is so entertaining that he only enhances the film.",7/10
5281,Death of a Cyclist (Muerte de un ciclista),A mannered guilt trip melodrama made with a great deal of difficulty under the Franco regime.,B+
5282,Death of a President,"Death of a President isn't art, or even entertainment: It's the art-house, indie-doc equivalent of Snakes on a Plane, where someone thought of a single idea and then, it seems based on the end-resulting film, stopped thinking altogether.",1/4
5283,Death Proof,"Despite some benefits in sequences that feature Zoe Bell, the new cut, which is 111 minutes (and not 127 as listed in the program), also brings to the surface weaknesses, resulting in a bloated, self-important picture.",B-
5284,Death Race,"DEATH RACE is going to please non-demanding moviegoers that love their flicks violent and action-packed. But this is like eating a generic brand of cereal, tastes okay until you have the real thing again.",2.5/4
5285,Death Race 2,"Hey, action films like Inception only come around every once in a while. We have to watch something!",3/5
5286,Death Race 2000,Don't miss it.,3/4
5287,Death Race 3: Inferno,"Feels like the unkempt offspring of Lock Up, Mad Max, and The Cannonball Run. Only not as good as those movies.",3/5
5288,Da uomo a uomo (Death Rides A Horse) (As Man to Man),...the film has the allure of watching Van Cleef and Law team up.,C
5289,Death Sentence,An unsatisfying and not-that-smart vigilante thriller.,2/5
5290,Death Takes a Holiday,Mitchell Leisen's surprisingly complex (especially with its brief 79 minute running time) film has proven itself immune to both time and remakes.,5/5
5291,Death to Smoochy,"A unique premise, an infectious performance by Norton, plenty of fun dialogue and kooky songs make for a groovy black comedy, with unfortunate faults which I for one...was willing to forgive.",7/10
5292,Death Wish,A minor classic that surpasses all expectations.,4/5
5293,Death Wish,"There's an adequate enough action to satisfy, but overall it's all been done before and better with Michael Winner's 1974 Charles Bronson-starring film.",5/10
5294,Death Wish 3,"In short, this movie could be recommended only to the most fanatical Charles Bronson fans or for the people who are already desperate for 1980s nostalgia.",3/10

5296,Death Wish II,All the blood and none of the brain.,2/5
5297,Death Wish V: The Face of Death,"While Mr. Bronson goes through the motions of revenge with his characteristic deliberation, he looks puffy and sounds terminally bored.",1/5
5298,Deathgasm,"Deathgasm is the ultimate midnight movie (for metalheads especially), hitting on notes of horror insanity that blend face-melting riffage with equally outstanding practical effects.",8/10
5299,The Deaths of Ian Stone,A mind-bending supernatural horror film with more promise than it delivers.,2/4
5300,Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons,"An ungainly script brings Deathstroke: Knights & Dragons down, but its near-constant bloody action and focus on underserved characters help it to be a solid outing for Deathstroke and a nice change of pace for DC's animated line.",3.5/5
5301,Deathtrap,"What eventually shines through, is how clever and manipulative the script is.",C+
5302,D.E.B.S.,D.E.B.S. is so unflinchingly cute that it forgets to be either funny or flat-out satiric.,1/4
5303,Debt Collectors,"Adkins' growing legion of fans will enjoy getting more of the same, and newcomers will get a solid sampler of what Adkins and Johnson have to offer.",B-
5304,Decasia,"Bill Morrison's Decasia is uncompromising, difficult and unbearably beautiful.",3.5/4
5305,Deceiver,"There wasn't much I could believe. The movie is basically about behavior -- about acting, rather than about characters.",2/4
5306,December Boys,The film squanders its rich sense of adolescent discovery with an undercurrent of sexism and the uninteresting ebb and flow of water-logged metaphor.,2/4
5307,Deception,"Despite its timid title, Deception has all the right ingredients for a decent tale of mystery. The real mystery is why this strong beginning led to such a weak and conventional conclusion.",2/5
5308,Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay,It never bothers to attempt the one thing we'd expect and hope from a documentary about Ricky Jay: It doesn't try to bamboozle us.,2.5/4
5309,Decision Before Dawn,The film manages to be suitably hard on the Nazi regime while providing one of the first sympathetic treatments of the German people.,3.5/5
5310,Deck the Halls,"Nothing says Christmas quite like incompetent slapstick, saccharine sermonizing, and cavernous cleavage.",0.5/4
5311,Declaration of War,The surest sign that a filmmaker recognizes the insularity of his or her project is the presence of perfunctory attempts to hint at a wider political context.,2/4
5312,The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years,"This is a well-made, observant documentary, with attitude to spare and plenty of justifiable laughs at the expense of its subjects.",3.5/4
5313,Decoding Annie Parker,"This isn't a film of bedside conversions or radical emotional transformations, nor is it a story about laughing at one's own hardships as a coping mechanism.",2.5/4
5314,Decoding Deepak,"Unlike his father, Gotham Chopra is more interested in his own latent daddy issues than with questions of cosmic import.",1.5/4
5315,Dead Sushi,"For all its absurdity Dead Sushi is truly a film made by a bunch of like-minded Japanese Lost Boys who are all just trying to have fun and make each other laugh, and it shows!",3.5/5
5316,Dedication,Check it out and enjoy the hijinks of this messed up children's book writer but don't look that far into it because you will be disappointed.,3.5/5
5317,The Deep,"Fairly shallow, actually.",2/5
5318,Deep Blue Sea 2,"Deep Blue Sea 2 is a wet, coarse fin slap to the face of its far superior, and infinitely more fun original shark thriller.",3/10
5319,Deep Blue Sea 3,"As opposed to other ""so-bad-they're-good"" shark films, this sequel draws viewers in with its genuineness and pays off with some truly jaw-dropping carnage.",3/5
5320,The Deep End,The gimmick that might have worked on serialized radio in the 1930's but not on the big screen today,3/5
5321,The Deep End of the Ocean,The Deep End of the Ocean is unconvincing from start to finish.,1.5/4
5322,Deep Impact,"In Deep Impact, the impending disaster is a grabber: A colossal comet ""the size of New York City"" races toward Earth, and an E.L.E. -- an extinction-level event -- seems likely. So everybody might as well get their houses in order.",B-
5323,Deep Red (Profondo rosso),"one of Argento's best films, as it prefigures some of the elaborate stylistic devices that would come to consume his later work, yet is still deeply embedded in a tight, absorbing narrative",3.5/4
5324,Deep Rising,"The South China Sea's answer to the Bermuda Triangle, but off-the-shelf acting and a hackneyed plot won't keep this oversized barge afloat.",0.5/4
5325,Deep Sea 3D,Imax 3D underwater cinematography is so spectacular that it doesn't matter how well the films are assembled.,3/5
5326,Deep Web,"""Deep Web"" has an undoubtedly fascinating subject, but don't be surprised if you walk away feeling like it's yet to be explored to its fullest potential.",C
5327,Deeply,A dull updating of a classic,2/5
5328,DeepStar Six,It's better than Sphere ... at 1/10th the price!,2.5/5
5329,Deepwater Horizon,Everything here feels routine-more like an inevitability than a work of art or even a piece of entertainment.,2/4
5330,Deerskin,"The nonsense, the dead times, the ridiculous spread to almost intolerable limits are some of the tools to which Dupieux assiduously attends in the film. [Full Review in Spanish]",7/10
5331,Defamation,"Intelligent, muscular documentary filmmaking that asks all the right questions about anti-Semitism today.",A-
5332,Defending Your Life,"The movie is funny in a warm, fuzzy way, and it has a splendidly satisfactory ending.",3.5/4
5333,Defendor,Harrelson is a master at keeping his character real.,3/5
5334,Defence of the Realm (Defense of the Realm),"The acting is strong throughout, but Elliott is especially effective. What is it about this actor, who has been in so many different kinds of movies and seems to make each role special?",3/4
5335,Defiance,"Craig heads a good cast in a largely unknown WWII tale of siblings who created a commune of warriors that contested the myth of Jews as passive victims, and while the subject is intriguing, Zwick's helming and film's execution leave much to be desired.",C+
5336,The Defiant Ones,"With two superb performances and palpable tension, the film has a strength that rises above the simplicity of the storyline.",4/4
5337,Deidra & Laney Rob a Train,"It's young Murray and Crow who give Deidra & Laney Rob a Train its spunk and its quicksilver emotional shifts, as the girls veer from criminal masterminds to argumentative siblings in no time flat.",3.5/4
5338,Déjà Vu,"After the flop of Domino, Scott has made a preposterously plotted sci-fi-thriller that shows his penchant for and state of the art technology but also increasing insensitivity to narrative logic.",C+
5339,Delgo,"Anything good that can be said about this movie tends to be hindered by the ugly animation, which pales in comparison to anything else being done in the field right now.",5.5/10
5340,Delhi 6,"Maybe the runaway success of Slumdog Millionaire will inspire western audiences to sample more authentic Bollywood fare; with its first-rate music, world-class stars, and postcard-ready views of India, Delhi 6 presents an especially welcomin",4/5
5341,Delhi Belly,"Das and Kapur make for effective sidekicks, it's pacy, fitfully funny and, in its determination to upend cultural expectations, likeably mischievous.",3/5
5342,Delhi Safari,"A much better way to strike home the same green message, while also having more fun, would be to just skip this movie and take your kids to a national park.",1.5/4
5343,Deli Man,"You will see better documentaries this year, but none more mouth-watering",3/4
5344,Delicatessen,"An amazing film, filled with amazing style, a wonderful off-beat tone, and some bits of satire which work with the film instead of being apart from it.",3.5/4
5345,Delirious,Excellent comedy. Really plays the soap opera and magic typewriter gimmicks to the fullest.,4/5
5346,Delirium,"[Martin] should look for better writers, to begin with.",1.5/4
5347,Deliver Us From Eva,A sweet piece of romantic comedy fluff that has its moments [but] you've seen it all before.,2.5/4
5348,Deliver Us from Evil,What further elevates Deliver Us From Evil beyond the poignancy and courage of O'Grady's victims and the sorrow of their devastated families is Berg's access to the pedophile himself.,9/10
5349,Deliver Us from Evil,The combination of demonic possession and the police procedural makes the film far more satisfying than it might have been otherwise.,7.5/10
5350,Deliverance,A harrowing film that can be appreciated on several levels.,91/100
5351,Delivery Man,"Writer-director Ken Scott does the same thing twice in repurposing his 2011 French-language film ""Starbuck"" into a Hollywood movie that predictably loses something in translation.",C-
5352,Delivery: The Beast Within,"A horror movie can be many things, but one thing it should never, ever be is tedious.",D
5353,De-Lovely,"Winkler and Cocks almost convince us that, despite his secrets, success and tortured later life, Porter is not interesting enough to warrant big-screen treatment.",2/5
5354,Delta Farce,"The story: Georgia 'weekend warriors' are shipped off to Iraq and somehow, between Georgia and Fallujah, the plane taking them dumps them into Mexico. No, the screenwriter didn't know how to read a map.",1/5
5355,The Delta Force,The Delta Force settles down into a well-made action film that tantalizes us with its parallels to real life.,3/4
5356,Delta Force 2: The Colombian Connection,"This world, geographically located anywhere between Miami and Bogota, is full of lots of rotting cheese.",15/100
5357,Delta of Venus,You need a decent script and quality actors to create something other than a series of soft-core fantasy vignettes.,59/100
5358,Dementia 13,Early Coppola horror tale that suffers from overt silliness.,55/100
5359,Demetrius and the Gladiators,"Old-time gladiator epic, and all the sweatiness that implies.",74/100
5360,Demolition,"Artistic and accessible, it's another bravado performance by Jake G, a sterling film by Vallée, and an all around impressive look into grieving from a very different and occasionally difficult perspective.",A-
5361,Demolition Man,"If you don't really think about it, [it] isn't a bad ride.",3.5/5
5362,Demon,"Demon raises many questions, but supplies no easy answers. What it delivers, however, is one of the scariest, most sickeningly creepy horror films of the year.",4/5
5363,Demon House,"Every time you think that things cannot get any stranger, the story keeps building and the tension keeps mounting... one of the single most compelling documentaries on the existence of the supernatural that I've ever witnessed.",4/5
5364,Demon Seed,Alternately fascinating and goofy.,3/5
5365,Demonlover,"What gets off to a promising start derails thoroughly due to confused plotting, lack of sympathetic characters and a pointless preoccupation with internet torture websites.",2/5
5366,Demons 2: The Nightmare Returns,"If you dug the first one, you'll probably enjoy about 30% of the sequel.",2/5
5367,Den of Thieves,"This gritty crime drama is so indebted to the work of Michael Mann, it might as well be called Residual Heat.",2/5
5368,Denial,"As courtroom dramas go, Denial just about has the lot.",4/5
5369,Denise Ho: Becoming the Song,"I went into the film knowing nothing about the Cantopop star, and came away from it as an instant fan rejuvenated by my connection to every soul throughout the world currently fighting to preserve human rights against the rising tide of totalitarianism.",3.5/4
5370,Dennis the Menace,"A movie that makes you leave the theatre with thoughts of having yourself, and your neighbors, spayed is not a good thing.",1/5
5371,The Departed,"Toplined by DiCaprio, Damon, and Nicholson, this crime-gangster film, loosely based on Infernal Affairs, reinvents the genre with a uniquely American saga that showcases Scorsese in top form.",A-
5372,Depraved,A fun and febrile tale that takes the moral temperature of our time with an almost invasive degree of accuracy.,B
5373,The Circle,An entertaining and edifying portrait of the gay scene in Zurich from the 1950s to 2003.,3/5
5374,Der Samurai,"It's a film better experienced than intellectualized, one that unfolds like a dream. And like a dream, afterwards, you'll probably ask yourself: Did I really just see that?",B
5375,Derailed,"Hafstrom is hamstrung by a Stuart Beattie script that telegraphs all its surprises and by two mismatched, miscast stars.",2/4
5376,Derailroaded,You don't have to be a fan of Larry 'Wild Man' Fischer's batty songs to appreciate Josh Rubin's compassionate portrait.,3/4
5377,Derrida,"As an introduction to the man's theories and influence, Derrida is all but useless; as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man, however, it's invaluable.",66/100
5378,Dersu Uzala,Beautifully photographed but far too isolated in its characterizations.,1/5
5379,Descendants 2,"'Descendants 2' has a better villain, some fun action beats, and a willingness to dive deeper into its subtext.",6/10
5380,The Descent,A grisly and gripping horror movie.,4/5
5381,Desert Bayou,"The lengthy and often heartbreaking interview sequences in the second half ultimately reveal a story that is, metaphorically at least, a tad less black-and-white.",B
5382,Desert Blue,"A movie like this depends on tone more than anything else. Moviegoers who don't like the rhythm may grow impatient. It's not a romance, a drama or an adventure, but the evocation of a time and place. The characters are odd because they grew up that way.",3/4
5383,Desert Dancer,The film's relentless turning of its characters' experience into platitudes and homilies is served for our too-easy consumption.,1.5/4
5384,The Desert Fox,Mason is great as the Nazi tank commander.,5/5
5385,Desert Hearts,I might have enjoyed Desert Hearts more if it had been more subtle and observant about the two women... And yet Desert Hearts has undeniable power.,2.5/4
5386,The Desert Rats,"Doesn't fare very well as a work of cinema, but if you take it as a fictionalised History channel documentary, you might find it compelling.",55/100
5387,Desert Saints,"Closer to Flashback than to Freeway, the Kiefer Sutherland vehicle Desert Saints is actually closer to Montana than either.",2/4
5388,Desierto,Any perceptive dialogue or contemporary socio-political subtext is pummeled by Jonás Cuarón's preference for empty genre thrills.,1.5/4
5389,Designing Woman,"Bright comedy, but nothing great",3/5
5390,Desk Set,"Stagey, but pleasant star vehicle",4/5
5391,Desperate Acts Of Magic,What makes this film impressive is an unending parade of magic tricks performed by experts and filmed without editing tricks or special effects.,8/10
5392,Desperate Living,Nonsense.,1.5/5
5393,Desperate Measures,Logic flies gloriously out the window at every possible opportunity.,2/5
5394,Desperately Seeking Susan,"This is a little slice of the decade of skinny ties and, well, Madonna, that holds up extremely well.",80/100
5395,Despicable Me 2,"Directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud know what works in this Looney Toons meets Pixar universe, with vibrant colours, memorable characters and slapstick comedy wonderfully meshing together.",4/5
5396,Despicable Me 3,"It was never going to be as sharp as the original Despicable Me, but even after eight years, there's still plenty here to like whether you're five or fifty-five.",3/5
5397,Despite The Falling Snow,"An old school romantic thriller that lacks the subtleties and sophistication of recent spy storytelling, be it on the big screen (Bridge Of Spies) or small (The Night Manager).",2/5
5398,Destination Tokyo,An intelligent WWII propaganda film.,B-
5399,Destination Wedding,"Amid all the arguing are brief moments where Frank spits out a hilarious zinger or an interesting topic of discussion arises, but those instances are few and far between, which is obviously not good in a movie that lives and dies by conversation",2/5
5400,Destiny (Der müde Tod),Fritz Lang's first noteworthy film is gorgeous to look at and highly imaginative.,4/5
5401,Destiny Turns on the Radio,"The opening scenes at least benefit from a sense of mystery. By the end, the movie is mired in its story and can't fight free of the cliches.",1/4
5402,Destroy All Monsters,All-star monster-fest isn't nearly as fun as I remembered.,2/5
5403,Destroyer,"Director Karyn Kusama shifts dexterously between the present and the past, unspooling a satisfyingly twisted piece of storytelling by writers Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi, who succeed in making both plots gripping.",3/4
5404,Destry Rides Again,Shows that the deconstruction of the Western began long before Unforgiven,4/5
5405,Detachment,[director] Tony Kaye dissects the contemporary classroom with unflinching realism in this heartbreaking drama.,4/5
5406,The Detective,"The Detective contains a fine performance by Frank Sinatra, some very good scenes of police work, and not much else.",3/4
5407,Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame,The costumes' stiffness sucks the giddiness out of frequently preposterous plot turns.,4/10
5408,Detective Story,"William Bendix is the best reason to see this yarn, a diverting story that never makes an impression proportionate to the talent of its cast and crew.",3/5
5409,Detention,"Nothing more than a loud, horrible cinematic experience that will leave horror fans demanding Kahn's head on a pike once the film gets released.",0.5/5
5410,Detention Of The Dead,"It hits way more than it misses, and there are some truly shining moments strewn throughout the flick to keep even the hungriest of gorehounds satisfied.",3/5
5411,Deterrence,"In order to get into this film, one must suspend a truckload of disbelief.",3/4
5412,Detour,"Detour, for those who have not seen it, may be the greatest achievement in B-movie making in history.",4/4
5413,Detour,The effect of the film becomes not unlike watching a puzzle solve itself without demanding either the audience's emotional or intellectual investment.,2/4
5414,Detroit,"""Detroit"" taps into something real and too familiar. Its vivacious and riveting interior matches its passionate and acute exterior.",3.5/4
5415,Detroit 9000,"As an example of the genre the French call a policier, the film is unexceptional.",2/5
5416,Detroit Rock City,"Look, that guy just got clocked by a telephone receiver. Twice. See? Funny!",1.5/4
5417,Detropia,A simultaneously surrealistic and sobering warning that the Motor City's host of woes might be coming soon to a town near you!,4/4
5418,Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo,"The good news is Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo, an insufferably insipid comedy with a cruel subtext, is only 84 minutes long.",D-
5419,Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo,A movie that exceeds your lowest expectations--it's not only coarse and raunchy but utterly unfunny.,D-
5420,Deuces Wild,"In its best moments, resembles a bad high school production of Grease, without benefit of song.",D
5421,Devil,"Taut and slickly directed, Devil is actually one of the more solid genre movies we've seen all year.",3/5
5422,The Devil and Max Devlin,Clumsy ol' Disney comedy.,2.5/5
5423,The Devil and Miss Jones,Very entertaining sub-Capra social comedy with great Charles Coburn performance.,4/5
5424,The Devil Came on Horseback,I really enjoyed the style of the film. Using [subject] Steidle's pictures he took while he narrates the letters he sent to his sister during his time in Sudan really make for an interesting narrative.,3.5/5
5425,Devil in a Blue Dress,"While Devil in a Blue Dress never develops the taut momentum of Franklin's previous effort, One False Move, it maintains audience involvement.",3/4
5426,The Devil's Advocate,"High art this may not be, and certainly no Paradise Lost, but fine filmic entertainment it most definitely is.",4/5
5427,The Devil's Backbone (El Espinazo del diablo),"With The Devil's Backbone, Guillermo del Toro pulls an Amenbar by deftly mixing bone-chilling dread with sophisticated war commentary.",3.5/4
5428,The Devil's Brigade,There was doubtless stupidity on both sides during the war; there's certainly no lack of it in The Devil's Brigade.,2.5/4
5429,The Devil's Chair ,"With only two horror flicks under his belt, Adam Mason's already a director to keep an eye on.",3.5/5
5430,Devil's Due,"Stale, derivative, and largely uneventful, testing the patience of moviegoers as directors Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett elect to conjure a sense of rehearsed reality, only to skip any justification for the images on the screen.",D
5431,Devil's Gate,"An irreverent mix of genres taken completely seriously but with no small amount of fun, Devil's Gate wears its script's stupidity on its sleeve and allows its creature effects and committed cast to carry it throughout.",6/10
5432,Devil's Knot,"What value is there in telling this story now, and in this way?""",4.8/10
5433,Devils on the Doorstep (Guizi lai le),"This boisterous comedy serves up a cruel reminder of the fate of hundreds of thousands of Chinese, one which can only qualify as a terrible tragedy.",4/5
5434,The Devil's Own,"The film should make it clear whether it considers the Brad Pitt character to be a hero or villain. My best guess is, he's a villain given a moral touch-up because he's also a movie star.",2.5/4
5435,The Devil's Rejects,"This is a violent, body-strewn road movie. And unless you're a fan of this kind of camp viciousness, it's pretty unbearable.",1.5/5
5436,The Dhamma Brothers,Examines the before and after mindsets of hardened cons converted to an Eastern spiritual path.,4/4
5437,Dheepan,A powerful film that has moments of sheer bravado.,A-
5438,Mumbai Diaries,"Move over Bollywood, because India is going indie.",3/4
5439,Dhoom: 2,"The pleasure principle is palpable in the giddy, slick Dhoom 2, a satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood.",4/5
5440,Diablo,"An obvious twist wrecks the story, and a good supporting cast upstages the Younger, Less Charismatic Eastwood in every scene.",1.5/4
5441,Dial A Prayer,"Just edgy enough to be interesting, maybe too edgy to qualify as a faith-based drama.",2.5/4
5442,Dial M for Murder,A rare and exciting experience.,3.5/4
5443,Diamonds Are Forever,"No matter how crazy it all gets, it never stops entertaining.",3/4
5444,Diana,It's hardly fascinating. It doesn't offer new facts about the Princess's life. And it certainly doesn't explain her complexity or contradictions.,2/5
5445,Diana Kennedy: Nothing Fancy,"A candid, frank, and comprehensive whirlwind tour through the life and work of one of the world's most celebrated (and uncompromising) chefs and cookbook authors.",8/10
5446,Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has To Travel,"A fashion world Who's Who offer accolades, while Vreeland's vulnerabilities are revealed in interviews telling how, ridiculed by her socialite mother as ugly, she invented herself on her own terms.",3/5
5447,Diane,"This intelligent, wonderfully textured film deserves a wide audience.",4.5/5
5448,Diane,"If some suspension of disbelief is required to accept the premise of Michael Mongillo's film, it's earned by Smith, whose troubled character is more sympathetic because he makes no effort to be liked.",3.5/5
5449,Diary of the Dead,"So yeah, it's a zombie flick crossed with the visual approach of The Blair Witch Project. But it's also quite a bit more than that.",4.5/5
5450,Diary of a Chambermaid (Le journal d'une femme de chambre),A very good film that should serve as good introduction to the one of the world's greatest filmmakers.,7/10
5451,Diary of a Lost Girl (Tagebuch einer Verlorenen),The Hollywood ideal corrupted by the deleterious social effects of the Third Reich remains one of the most haunting synergies in silent film.,4/4
5452,Diary of a Mad Black Woman,Perry's film adaptation clearly preaches to the converted while presupposing its TV-sitcom humor will win (or convert) new fans.,1/4
5453,Diary of a Wimpy Kid,"A jaunty and forthright production with a lively look reflecting the book's illustrated pages [that] does a great job of being in two places at once: In the head and gangly bodies of kids, and in the hearts of those of us who have survived grades 6-8.",B+
5454,Diary of a Wimpy Kid 2: Rodrick Rules,"Emphasizes the psychopathic torment to a shrill degree, leaving me to wonder why Greg doesn't simply beat his fiendish brother to death with a pillowcase filled with soda cans.",D+
5455,Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days,Slightly better than its predecessors - although it's still the same disjointed fluff about an aloof American middle-class kid with a bunch of hang-ups.,2/5
5456,Diary Of A Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul,The film's problem isn't so much the grossness of its humor as the laziness with which it's executed.,1.5/4
5457,The Diary of Anne Frank,"The first film to deal with the Holocaust on such an affecting and personal level, this is a powerful and painfully tragic film.",4/5
5458,Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star,strictly ordinary and joins the ranks of the soon to be forgotten,2.5/5
5459,Die Another Day,"Sexy, funny and spectacular, Bond's first mission of the new millennium is one of the best of the series.",5/5
5460,Die! Die! My Darling!,"As crazy as the tale was, it all seemed possible.",C
5461,Die Fälschung (Circle of Deceit),The humanist Circle of Deceit charts the many moral quandaries encountered by a journalist when he's sent to Beirut to catalog the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war.,3.5/4
5462,Die Hard,"an intelligent game of cat-and-mouse, complete with some proposterous situations, a lot of carnage, some male bonding, one strong woman, lots and lots of one-liners, and it even has a villain coming back from the dead for one last kiss goodnight.",4/4
5463,Die Hard 2,"This is an enjoyable action film: nothing requiring great thought, but certainly enjoyable.",6/10
5464,Die Hard: With a Vengeance,"Basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.",3/4
5465,"Die, Monster, Die!",Ineffective Lovecraft adaptation saved by Karloff presence.,3/5
5466,Die Wand (The Wall),"Introspective but rarely cerebral, The Wall is too frustratingly obtuse despite boasting a solid central performance and lush visuals.",2/5
5467,Dig!,a striking original chronicle comparing two rival bands,B+
5468,Dig Two Graves,"less than totally coherent, and the style of the film puts too many obstacles in the viewer's path",6/10

5471,Digging to China,A groundbreaking performance by Kevin Bacon,3/5
5472,Digging Up the Marrow,"Could have used another polish on the screenplay level, but there is a cleverness to its conception and warranted confidence in its tension that cannot be refuted.",2.5/4
5473,Diggstown,More people should be fans of this movie.,4.5/5
5474,Dil Bole Hadippa! (My Heart Goes Hooray!),"It is nice to see cricket being used as a metaphor for ameliorating relations between India and Pakistan. East or West? Good heavens, it's the Punjab that's the best!",4/5
5475,Dilili in Paris (Dilili à Paris),"'Dilili in Paris' is a kid-friendly, family film that takes viewers on an epic journey throughout Paris. Ocelot's attention to detail makes this animated film a must see.",5/5
5476,Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart,"What is remarkable is the way Wang deals with this complex set of emotions, in a movie that is essentially a comedy.",3/4
5477,Dim Sum Funeral,Overly melodramatic and soap operatic. Very familiar episodic look at a comtemporary Chinese/American family and the gaps that divide them.,2/5
5478,Diminished Capacity,"The milieu is interesting but there's too much acting (particularly by Alda) in this quasi-witty, semi-melancholy road comedy, perhaps a result of helmer Kinney's theatrical background and lack of directorial skills.",C
5479,Diner,Witty and fun.,4/5
5480,Dinner for Schmucks,"There's rapport between Steve Carell and Paul Rudd, well cast as the Odd Couple, but the source material (French farce), which was nastier in dissecting manners and mores, has been softened and the comedy is not funny enough.",C+
5481,The Dinner Game (Le Dîner de cons),French farce as it's rarely done these days -- well.,3.5/5
5482,Dinner with Friends,"As an adult drama, Dinner With Friends is apt enough at exploring late-thirtysomething angst and crisis, well acting and paced with enough momentum to keep the story from dragging.",3/5
5483,Dinosaur 13,"Fascinating story of the discovery of some T-Rex bones, sale of those bones and the battle over who owns them",3/4
5484,Dinosaurs Alive! 3D,The project's larger purpose is clearly to stimulate academic interest in youngsters brought up on Jurassic Park-style thrills.,2.5/4
5485,Dinosaurs: Giants of Patagonia,"Rare among large-format movies, Patagonia even has a sense of humor, nicely underplayed by narrator Donald Sutherland.",3.5/4
5486,Dinotasia,This decision to avoid treating the dinosaurs as surrogate people for easy identification is both the film's boldest move and the source of much of its problems.,2.5/4
5487,Dior and I,"...Dior And I succeeds in bringing this exclusive world down to earth, knitting the viewer with its needles and threads and making a highly relatable story, no matter where you come from or how you feel about fashion.",B+
5488,Diplomacy,Diplomacy's origins as a play (written by Cyril Gely and starring the same actors) are always evident.,3/5
5489,Dirt Music,"The melody of ""Dirt Music,"" once off-key, finally finds the right chords, nearly too late.",C+
5490,Dirty Dancing,"The movie plays like one long, sad, compromise; it places packaging ahead of ambition.",1/4
5491,Dirty Dancing,"The original Dirty Dancing was no paragon of cinematic excellence, but boy, does it look like Swan Lake next to The Hokey Pokey that is ABC's remake of the 1987 film.",D
5492,Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights,"Guilty pleasure? I wish! The movie features two kids who can't dance, which the editors try their best to hide.",1/4
5493,The Dirty Dozen,"The Dirty Dozen has always been highly regarded by both war movie fans and action fans alike. The movie's deeper thematic material is left in the subtext, allowing those who prefer to ignore it to do so comfortably.",3/4
5494,Dirty Girl,"For a movie hellbent on marketing itself as the seedy tale of a small-town tramp, Dirty Girl sure has an odd way of making good on its promise.",1.5/4
5495,Dirty Grandpa,Dirty Grandpa is the worst movie I've ever seen in a movie theater.,0/10
5496,Dirty Harry,"The Dirty Harry films declined over the years, but the original's one worth seeking out.",4/5
5497,Dirty Love,There's a really good film in here kicking and screaming (and bleeding) to get out.,3/5
5498,Dirty Mary Crazy Larry,"The film is so bereft of emotion and so full of physical movement that it's possible this is a point that John Hough, the director, and the screenwriters wanted to make. It's a very small point to be made by such a noisy picture.",1.5/5
5499,Dirty Pretty Things,"Where most directors would wring their hands over the misery and exploitation of illegals, Frears seizes on their drive rather than their despair.",5/5
5500,Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"The chemistry between Martin and Caine is fun, and Headly provides a resilient foil as a woman who looks like a pushover but somehow never seems to topple.",3/4
5501,A Dirty Shame,"This NC-17 freak show could just as easily have been called All That MPAA Allows, and here it's plenty.",3/4
5502,Dirty Wars,"Ably leads us through its extensive investigation, faltering only when the camera lingers on Jeremy Scahill for a touch too long at the expense of his interview subjects.",3/5
5503,Disappearance at Clifton Hill,"Niagara's clash between gaudy neon lights, dingy diners, shadowy alleys and general David Lynch vibes sets the stage for a mystery that may only be imagined.",4/5
5504,The Disappearance of Alice Creed,...never quite becomes either as stagy or as claustrophobic as one might've assumed.,2.5/4
5505,The Disappearance of Garcia Lorca,"This film is really not so much about [Garcia Lorca] as about memory and history -- about how poets are given most of their power not by those who love them, but by those who fear them.",3/4
5506,Disappearances,"An utterly earnest, likable enough family-focused action-adventure.",2.5/4
5507,Disappearing Acts,"""Disappearing Acts"" is a made-for-cable film that's better than almost anything released in a commercial theater this year.",4/4
5508,Disaster Movie,"Come on, pedophilia is funny and a Michael Jackson joke is never not timely, right? Wrong. It's not timely or funny.",1/5
5509,Disclosure,"If you can turn off your Vulcan circuits and ignore illogical loopholes, Disclosure generally delivers the goods.",2.5/4
5510,Disco Pigs,Deserves to be remembered long after the house lights have gone up.,4/5
5511,Disco Godfather,Peerless camp blaxploitation.,4/5
5512,Disconnect,...a consistently compelling and surprisingly moving drama that remains a cut above similarly themed fare...,4/4
5513,Discreet,"As the tension builds to its harrowing conclusion, and Alex begins to bare his teeth, Mathews pulls enough tricks from his sleeve to make Discreet a worthy digression.",B-
5514,The Discreet Charm Of The Bourgeoisie (Le Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie),"But though Buuel himself is gone, his films remain to skewer [the bourgeoisie] whenever we feel the urge to see them humiliated.",4/4
5515,The Disenchanted,The film had a very lively pulse which added to its intelligent drama.,B-
5516,Disgrace,Malkovich's unabashed performance drives a fierce fable which seems intent on forcing viewers away.,3/5
5517,The Dish,Emotional and inspirational and funny in that quirky down-under sort of way.,4/4
5518,Disneynature Bears,"Co-directors Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey's stirringly captured movie unlocks a sincere sense of awe and reverence within viewers' hearts, even as it frustrates an audience looking for a bit more.",3/5
5519,Disneynature Chimpanzee,Chimpanzee gives us a fully smoothed-out story -- about an orphan ape named Oscar -- populated with chimps so cute and Disney-fied that you half expect them to break out in an Alan Menken song.,B
5520,Disneynature Crimson Wing,A solid example of that most endangered of species -- a well-made family film.,3.5/5
5521,Disneynature Earth,"For fans of wildlife programmes, Earth will be nothing new - it is, after all, a re-cut version of the BBC series Planet Earth -- but this is a wildlife film at the very top of its game.",3/5
5522,Disneynature Monkey Kingdom,A populist take on simian society and alpha leadership leads to an entertaining look at caste systems in the animal kingdom.,80/100
5523,Disneynature Oceans,This hypnotically photogenic journey into the depths of the ocean blue exists to appeal to the imaginations of young and old alike.,3/4
5524,Aladdin,Those of you expecting the comfy family-sedan ride of Beauty and the Beast are in for a shock-the immensely enjoyable Aladdin roars off the Disney production line like the latest-model sports car.,A
5525,Disobedience,"Sebastian Lelio once again shows a remarkable sensitivity to the challenges women face, particularly those who are marginalized by their age or identity.",B+
5526,Disorder (Maryland),The film lurches to a generically overwrought climax which manages to just about hold the attention but frustrate with its emptiness. I'd have happily rewatched the first half instead.,3/5
5527,The Disorderly Orderly,"There are a few sight gags that are funny, which keep it from being a complete waste.",C
5528,Disorganized Crime,I guess I have a soft spot for these semi-desperate ensemble comedies.,3/5
5529,Distorted,Rapid-fire disturbing images in paranoid thriller.,2/5
5530,Banlieue 13 - Ultimatum (District 13: Ultimatum),"The dialogue and storyline are both a little on the clunky side, but the action excels.",3/5
5531,District 9,"Neill Blomkamp's visceral and thumping debut presents a fascinating and effective vision of the future, and of humanity itself.",4/5
5532,District B13 (Banlieue 13),One of the best adrenaline rushes since we saw Lola running for 90 minutes.,3.5/4
5533,Disturbia,"Slickly shot, generally well-acted, and entirely, predictably conventional from stem to stern.",2.5/5
5534,Disturbing Behavior,It's like the makers of this film were so desperate to get a film together that they went to a horror paint-by-numbers book to get everything they needed.,0/5
5535,Disturbing The Peace,"By focusing on combatants from both sides who came together to bring about change, Disturbing the Peace is a rejoinder to pessimism, delivering a message of hope that lands with some success.",7.5/10
5536,Disturbing the Peace,What the hell did Guy Pearce do to lower himself appearing in low rent generic action fare such as this,1/5
5537,William Kunstler: Disturbing the Universe,"His oft-spoken use of Michelangelo's David as a personal symbol of the individual's decision to bring ""power to the people"" gives better insight into this jurist's fiery heart than any case study.",2.5/4
5538,Divergent,The film transcends the déjà vu of its borrowed trappings but ironically sacrifices all momentum in favor of a long series of physical tests.,2/4
5539,Divide and Conquer: The Story of Roger Ailes,"Fleet, lucid, and very watchable, the film is as ruthlessly effective and goal-oriented as its namesake.",B
5540,Divided We Fall,The cast ... performs with such subtlety and ingenuity that all sense of narrative artifice vanishes.,3.5/5
5541,Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood,"We've got the chick flick of the year, here... and not a moment too soon!",4/5
5542,Divines,A decent yet erratic debut...,2/4
5543,Divorce American Style,Trivia alert: Tim Matheson is Debbie's teenage son,4/5
5544,The Divorcée,[Shearer] certainly deserved her Oscar for this one.,4/5
5545,Dixie Chicks - Shut Up and Sing,"Sharp and engaging, Dixie Chicks is a funky, raw, and passionate documentary portrait of the superb musical group, infused with a novelistic sense of surprise and events spiraling out of control.",B
5546,Dixieland,"Low on ideas and high on atmosphere, ""Dixieland"" is a promising debut, but it likely won't find you overwhelmingly writing back home about it.",C
5547,Django,One of the greatest of all Spaghetti Westerns.,5/5
5548,Django,The film's most crucial shortcoming lies in its failure to illuminate both the inner life of its subject and his artistic genius.,1.5/4
5549,Django Unchained,"Quentin Tarantino doesn't shy away from the horrors of slavery in Django Unchained even as he delivers a weird, wild, and bloody violent crowd-pleaser in this raucous salute to the spaghetti western.",9.4/10
5550,Do I Sound Gay?,An entertaining documentary.,3/4
5551,Do Knot Disturb,"Instead of casting the picture with two former Miss Universes, the filmmakers would have done well to punch-up a script and attend to the chintzy musical composition.",1.5/5
5552,Do Not Resist,"Unfortunately, the interest of immediacy of the conversation seems to trump thorough journalism.",C+
5553,Do the Right Thing,"This may not be the best film of the summer, but it is the most ambitious.",8/10
5554,Do You Believe?,"Juggling so many story lines is a major task, but director Jonathan M. Gunn manages to service all the stories while holding true to the movie's main message.",B
5555,Do You Trust this Computer?,"Information is presented in something of a blur, but this is still a chilling and eye-opening look at our digitally-obsolete future.",3/4
5556,DOA: Dead or Alive,You know what to expect with Paul WS Anderson onboard as producer.,2/5
5557,Doc Holliday,The movie really does give you a sense of inhabiting the West.,3.5/4
5558,Doc Hollywood,"Predictable as sunburn on the 4th of July, it is a film as ingratiating as its star.",3/5
5559,Doctor Dolittle,"Unfortunately -- even as escapist fare -- it's a failure due to its lifeless, meandering plot, and characters.",45/100
5560,Doctor Faustus,"Doctor Faustus is a complete misfire on every single level, a failure the likes of which most supposedly bad movies can't even come close to.",0/4
5561,Doctor Strange,"""At times it will leave you in awe of what you're watching unfold in front of your eyes.""",4/5
5562,Dodgeball - A True Underdog Story,Can somebody please stop Ben Stiller?...The (movie's) one vicariously vengeful pleasure is seeing the actors repeatedly take real shots to the head from big red rubber balls.,1/4
5563,Dodsworth,"A film of maturity, intelligence, and understanding.",5/5
5564,Dog Day Afternoon,Benefits immeasurably from a cast and crew doing some of the finest work of their careers.,5/5
5565,Dog Days,"Marino keeps the feature as unthreatening as possible, with as many tongue-flapping canine close-ups as possible, and he's capable of so much more than this lethargic sameness.",D+
5566,Dog Eat Dog,Plot strands are left dangling; but Schrader carries it off. He still has flair.,4/5
5567,Dog Park,Woof!,1.5/5
5568,Dog Pound,"It's painful, beautiful, heart wrenching and endearing and will leave you completely overtaken by the events you just witnessed.",4/5
5569,Dog Soldiers,"A grim, flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level.",1/4
5570,Doghouse,"The magic ingredient here is Dan Schaffer's sly script, which constantly undercuts the film's inherently sexist premise.",3/5
5571,Dogtooth (Kynodontas),Suffice to say that we won't be seeing an American remake of this one any time soon.,4/5
5572,Dogtown and Z-Boys,"The rebellion, the rock music, and the frenetic introduction to skating culture all combine to make [this] one of the most entertaining and fun movies of the year.",4/4
5573,Dogville,It's precisely [this] arrogance that makes von Trier such a dynamic force in modern filmmaking.,9/10
5574,"Doin' It in the Park: Pick-Up Basketball, NYC","Perhaps the first important film about street hoops, even if the overall product struggles from a lack of focus.",2.5/4
5575,La Dolce Vita,The movie is made with boundless energy. Fellini stood here at the dividing point between the neorealism of his earlier films ... and the carnival visuals of his extravagant later ones.,4/4
5576,Dolemite,"This is not a good or enjoyable movie, no matter what the hip guy in your film class says.",0.5/5
5577,Dolemite Is My Name,"""My Name is Dolemite,"" is a fairly conventional biopic. But it's put together with such energy and affection that the disparity is forgivable.",B+
5578,Dolittle,"""I loved it, I laughed, because it felt good to be a kid again. A star-filled cast of Dolittle comes together to create a beautiful film. Robert Downey Jr. is pure magic. """,9.6/10
5579,$ (Dollars) (The Heist),"A pleasant, somewhat underrated chase movie.",3.5/4
5580,Dolly Parton's Coat of Many Colors,Simply beautiful and beautifully simple.,8/10
5581,Dolores Claiborne,"A character study, which was very effective, and a mood piece, which was overdone.",3/4
5582,Dolphin Tale,"Despite few moments of cornball and some gratuitous 3D, Dolphin Tale is irresistibly cute and undeniably touching--an enjoyable film for all members of the family.",B+
5583,Dolphin Tale 2,Writer-director Charles Martin Smith's tin ear for dialogue and contrived symbolism is as unmistakable as his enormous heart.,2.5/4
5584,Dolphins,"Overall, pleasant and fun, it'll keep a smile plastered on your face for the first five minutes, before it dips a bit into documentary pace.",2.5/4
5585,Dom Hemingway,"Mixing two parts Irvine Welsh, one part Bronson, a few dashes of perversity, all wrapped in a blanket of excess, Jude Law takes that bundle, bites heartily into the role of Dom, chews it up, swallows and pisses it right back out with glee.",B+
5586,Domain,"Domain is most entertaining when it gets twisted, and headstrong survivors Phoenix and Denver succumb to online dating and decide it's time to break out of this false reality.",B
5587,Domestic Disturbance,"Domestic Disturbance features John Travolta's twinkly-eyed Phenomenon persona and Vince Vaughn and Teri Polo's shared ""I might be a cunning polymer"" persona.",1.5/4
5588,Dominick Dunne: After the Party,"Jolley and de Garis never come close to revealing whatever lurks in the heart of this intelligent, ambitious, plainly unhappy and not particularly admirable man, who bears scars from many wounds, not all of them self-inflicted.",2/5
5589,Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist,"I hate to side with bottom line-obsessed studio executives, but Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is as dreadfully boring, ridiculous, and pompous as rumored.",1.5/4
5590,Domino,"A challenging, complicated and hilarious heist thriller",4/5
5591,Domino,"A bravura finale that is vintage DePalma doesn't make up for the drab, generic thriller that precedes it.",1.5/4
5592,Don Juan DeMarco,"A light hearted, fairy tale of a romance, there is not much in it, but what there is is a delight and will reaffirm your belief in life and especially in romance.",2.5/4
5593,Don 2,"More than a worthy sequel, it is simply an exciting and downright fun thrill ride of a movie, period, and Farhan Akhtar deserves his due as one of the great mainstream film talents currently working anywhere, period.",3.5/4
5594,Don Jon,"Don Jon's Addiction is a fun, occasionally flabby romp that should find its audience.",3/5
5595,Don McKay,"More a black comedy than the intended ""neo-noir"" that newbie auteur Jake Goldberger aspires to, ""Don McKay"" is a droll little independent flick for audiences with dark tastes.",C
5596,Don Peyote,"Don Peyote is a delusional, hallucinogenic journey into the mind of an apocalypse obsessed lunatic - a jumbled puzzle of ideas missing a few crucial connections.",5/10
5597,Don Quixote,"Using guesswork and very little talent, a bunch of well-intentioned film buffs tried to piece together a lot of raw footage into something resembling the work of one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. They failed.",3/10
5598,Don Verdean,"Quirky fun. Sam Rockwell, Leslie Bibb and Jermaine Clement are great.",7/10
5599,Donkey Punch,The unique use of character dynamics combined with Blackburn's keen visual sense makes it a thinking person's horror flick that surpasses its genre by introducing a viable new cinematic voice and vision.,8.5/10
5600,Donnie Brasco,Pacino cans the showboating bluster and gives a gently nuanced portrait of a simple man in decline.,4/4
5601,Donnie Darko,"It is fascinating, lyrical filmmaking and it demands multiple viewings to wring the most out of it.",3/4
5602,Donnybrook,"It's a pulpy slab of exploitation masquerading as an important treatise on the struggles faced by the working class in rural America, thumping us in the face with its shallow viewpoint until we beg for mercy. Or at least the credits.",2/5
5603,Donovan's Echo,"Billed as a ""supernatural thriller,"" Donovan's Echo feels more like an overwrought made-for-TV movie.",1/4
5604,Donovan's Reef,"A promising premise, gorgeous scenery and an entertaining performance by John Wayne are wasted in this formulaic and self-contradictory John Ford effort.",63/100
5605,Don't Ask Don't Tell,Overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste.,2/5
5606,Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in The Hood,"Rude, crude and outrageous.",2.5/4

5608,Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark,"'Dark 'is an engaging, well-paced and scary horror film... it's a gateway horror flick, one that will push the younger generation into our sick and twisted world.",3.5/5

5610,Don't Bother to Knock,Fairly satisfying,4/5
5611,Don't Breathe,The first two-thirds are as solid a piece of thriller filmmaking as Hollywood has produced in a while.,8/10
5612,Don't Call Me Son (Mãe Só Há Uma),The film fails to explore any of the numerous dramatic possibilities the story had to offer. [Full review in Portuguese.],2/5

5614,Don't Come Knocking,"Judging by this meandering and diffuse Western, middle-age hasn't been kind to Wim Wenders and Sam Shepard, whose first teaming, Paris, Texas, was far superior",C
5615,Don't Go,"Moody, scenic and well-acted Irish ghost story",2.5/4
5616,Don't Go in the House,Don't go to this movie.,1/5
5617,Don't Hang Up,[T]he buildup is wrecked by a climactic showdown that pulls out some really cheap fake-outs and an unpleasant touch of nihilism.,2/4
5618,Don't Kill It,"Mendez has clearly mapped out something bigger, but it doesn't matter if we never see the whole thing; like health insurance, just knowing it's there is enough. On top of this, the gore-fests are glorious, never letting the viewer feel cheated.",3/5
5619,Don't Knock Twice,The film's storylines fail to inform or intensify each other in any theme-deepening or character-developing ways.,2/4
5620,Don't Leave Home,...Tully's creepy Catholic allegory hits high notes in its climax that recall Kubrick and Polanski.,B
5621,Don't Let Go (Relive),"The main issue with Relive is that once you learn the big gimmick, the ingenuity stops there and the film falls back on overused film clichés.",C-
5622,Dont Look Back,"As Pennebaker's film clearly shows, one thing hasn't changed: Dylan only asks questions. You provide the answers.",8/10
5623,Don't Look Now,"What makes Don't Look Now stick with you is the potent undertow, the sense of guilt and despair that suffuses the Venice locations and plasters itself across Sutherland's scowling face.",A-
5624,Hot Pursuit,As entertaining as watching a dogfight between two Chihuahuas inside a burlap sack.,3/10
5625,Don't Say a Word,"From Hollywood's school of pop psychology comes Don't Say a Word, a Freud for Dummy's journey into mind-cracking.",1.5/4
5626,Don't Sleep,"Confusing, heartless, fright-free and sleep-inducing horror exploitation.",1/4
5627,Don't Stop Believin': Everyman's Journey,"It's nice to watch the members marvel unendingly over their new find, while Pineda himself presents an ideal image of gratitude and hard work.",3/5
5628,Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead,The souls of these little monsters are much too black to be redeemed within the confines of an hour and a half film.,0/5
5629,Don't Think Twice,The imperfections of Don't Think Twice are fitting for a movie about artistic expression that's never quite finished.,A-
5630,Don't Torture a Duckling,One of the best giallo films made by Lucio Fulci.,B
5631,Don't Trip...He Ain't Through with Me Yet,"You may be left wondering, When the show is this short (78 minutes) and the comedy this sanitized (0 expletives), why not put it on TV instead of in theaters?",C
5632,"Don't Worry, He Won't Get Far on Foot","The movie falls short of deep insights, but its most prominent qualities - scrappy, ephemeral, a little bit lewd - mirror the chief attributes of Callahan's endearing work.",B-
5633,Doom,I recommend Doom with a lot of hesitation.,6.8/10
5634,Doom: Annihilation,A forgettable cast and subpar action further dooms the reputation of yet another video game movie adaptation.,4/10
5635,The Doom Generation,Good luck searching for meaning -- you'll find mostly blood and epithets.,D
5636,Doomsday,Here's a gorefest that also includes a little story line.,1/4
5637,Doomsday Book,"What impresses most is the consistent, clear tone and vision throughout; the comedy never up-ends the thoughtful elements, nor the other way around. Balance is key, and as such, Doomsday Book is well worth the long wait.",3.5/5
5638,The Doors,It seems more the glorification of an alcoholic jerk than a cautionary tale.,1.5/4
5639,Dopamine,"Director Mark Decena and co-writer, Tim Breitbach, have formulated that rare screenplay that adapts out of its characters and not a predetermined road. The camera doesn't just love Sabrina Lloyd - it's looking to get down on one leg and propose.",3.5/4

5711,Dragonslayer,"Dragonslayer - which incredulously picked up the Best Documentary award at SXSW - is probably the first ever hagiography made about someone who is, without doubt, completely unremarkable. But at least at 74-minutes, it won't keep you for too long.",2/5

5737,Drive,Gaping gaps in the plotline recede into the background in the face of ordinary car chases that routinely look plastic and an embarrassingly low-brow extended climax that feels like the work of an entry-level animation student.,0.5/5

5761,Drunken Master (Jui kuen),"Not unlike the silent films of Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd, or for that matter, the best pictures of Hong Kong's Seventies kung fu films, the genius of Drunken Master lies in its kinetics. Pure entertainment, and a true chop-socky classic.",4/5
5762,The Dry Land,Sometimes the truth doesn't set you free.,2/4

5834,Easy Living,A fascinating character study in self-destructive alcoholism utterly undone by an absurd in-the-extreme finale.,2/4
5835,Easy Money: Hard to Kill,There's ultimately little in the way of authentically resonant drama underneath the film's self-conscious busy-ness.,2/4
5836,Easy Rider,More important for what it did to liberate film from the studios than good,4/5
5837,Eat Drink Man Woman (Yin shi nan nu),"The personalities in this well-drawn family combine to produce subtle new flavors -- and in the end, no one is spiced as you'd imagined they'd be.",A-
5838,Eat Pray Love,"Julia Roberts boasts a charming presence and a lively mind but she deserves better than this superficial, glitzy and fluffy travelogue of self discovery, which has lots of food, some prayers but little love or sex.",C
5839,Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in His Own Words,It's a perfectly fine first step into Zappa's world of highly controlled insanity.,B+
5840,Eating,"The movie makes its point early and often: That its characters are hung up on food, and eat for unhealthy and obsessive reasons. It's true. We know it's true. We wait in vain for additional insights.",2/4
5841,Eating Animals,I had hoped this doc would focus on Foer's evolution in favor of vegetarianism but instead it is a mostly a look at the way small farms have been crushed by agribusiness.,B
5842,Eating Out,"A slight sex comedy that would work far better on stage than screen, where it seems far too talky and too slow.",2/5
5843,Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds,The film relishes in capturing those fluid days of youthful abandon when everyone's sexual agency was up for grabs.,2.5/4
5844,Eating Out: All You Can Eat,"Not that nuance must be a comedy's forte, but most of All You Can Eat unravels as a series of self-conscious fragments and bitchy one-liners.",1.5/4

5846,Eating Up Easter,Eating Up Easter is deft in the way it explores ... finding a balance between vital tradition and the unstoppable momentum of modernity.,3/4
5847,Echelon Conspiracy,"This latest take on Bush-era paranoia and cell phone alarm might arrive in theaters somewhat dramatically moldy and short-sheeted in the budget department, yet it's actually a more rewarding sit than Eagle Eye if viewed with minimal attention paid",C-
5848,Echo In the Canyon,I have a feeling Echo in the Canyon will be watched for decades into the future as the essential document of a very specific time and place that changed music forever.,10/10
5849,Echoes of Innocence,A film that tries to be all heart at the expense of the brain.,2/5
5850,Echoes of War,"Echoes of War may not be the most dazzling movie of its kind ever made, but the solid acting and engaging ideas make it worth seeing.",3/4
5851,Ecstasy,"Clearly has affection for the source material and the cinematic subgenre it reflects, which is probably why it's so terrible.",1/5
5852,Ed,"Why Bill Couturie, who produced the affecting AIDS-quilt docu Common Threads, took on this howler is as mysterious as the theory of evolution. Why LeBlanc gave up hiatus for the role is as mysterious as Hollywood.",D-

5855,EDC 2013: Under the Electric Sky,"Under The Electric Sky is a fun backstage pass for EDC fans, but for DJ haters it'll just be a loud, obnoxious headache - so they should just stay away and let everyone else eat, sleep, rave, and repeat.",7/10

5862,Eden,"Glamour is twinned with mundanity, beauty with boorishness and friendship with selfishness, while artistic endeavour is undercut by self-indulgence.",4/5
5863,Eden Lake,"Has some seriously haunting themes torn right from the headlines, giving us something thoughtful to chew on. Besides our fingernails.",4/5
5864,Eden Log,"Pitched between serious hard sci-fi and a mindless creature feature, it is mostly distinguished by its willingness to immerse its audience in its plot midstream.",50/100
5865,The Edge,Bart the Bear delivers the film's most memorable performance.,2/4
5866,Edge of Darkness,A shot that defiantly fixes on Mel Gibson's balding pate from behind is the only evidence of the volatile actor-director's famous penchant for cinematic self-flagellation here.,1.5/4
5867,The Edge of Love,"As a look at two women who find an unusual connection, it's rather beautiful.",3.5/5
5868,Edge of Seventeen,"It takes its tone of mournful defiance from Bronski Beat's ""Smalltown Boy,"" that great, quavery ode to the pain of liberation.",B-

5892,El Aura (The Aura),"There's lots of suspense here, and the ending is actually perversely satisfying.",3/5

5895,El Camino Christmas,"Dreadful, but it's difficult to tell who's to blame for this mess.",D
5896,El Cantante,"El Cantante is driven by the rhythmic, pulsating sounds of Lavoe's music, without which the film would be nothing.",6/10

5899,El Mariachi,"A gripping, tautly-paced action flick that outdoes most of Hollywood's similar output.",3/4
5900,El Norte,"The film has a political message, but it is a subtle and compelling one that allows situations and characters to speak for themselves.",4/4
5901,El Topo,"The surrealist filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky created his own midnight cult version of the Spaghetti Western which, once seen, is not easily forgotten. Some of his macabre and mystical images linger, both fascinating and strange.",5/5
5902,Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me,"Stritch's fearlessness in the face of age and illness dominates; whether she's ribbing 30 Rock's ""Alec 'Joan Crawford' Baldwin"" or berating cinematographer Shane Signer - ""Don't you think you're awfully close to me?!"", her default setting is candid.",3.5/5
5903,Election,"As Tracy Flick, Witherspoon perfectly tows the line between cute and irritating.",3.5/5

5907,The Electric Horseman,"The middle is heavy on romance between the two stars -- both megawatt powers in 1979 -- but the central plot, about a stolen horse for God's sake! -- doesn't carry the weight director Sydney Pollack might like us to believe.",3/5
5908,Electric Man,More geek creak than geek chic.,2/5
5909,Electric Slide,"Tiresomely told, uninteresting and turgid, Electric Slide is as insipid as it gets - a meaningless movie about almost nothing at all.",D-

5911,Elektra,Elektra would have been far better off staying dead.,1/4
5912,Elektra Luxx,"While there's certainly trouble to be had, just like its predecessor, Women in Trouble, the characters manage to keep you from completely dismissing this sloppy mess.",2.5/5

5914,Elephant,Van Sant stretches the lexicon of filmmaking with a stylized technique of cinematic storytelling outside the known genre norms.,3.5/5
5915,Elephant Walk,...astonishingly bad...,0.5/4
5916,Elevator to the Gallows (Ascenseur pour l'échafaud),An intelligent thriller that served as an important precursor in the late 1950s to such New Wave classics as Breathless and The Four Hundred Blows.,4/5
5917,Elf,"Yes, the story is truly silly, but it maintains a timeless quality that lets us suspend our cynical disbelief.",3/5
5918,Elf: Buddy's Musical Christmas,"As holiday newcomers go, this is much better than socks and underwear from Grandma. Just don't expect a shiny new train set.",B-
5919,Elfie Hopkins,"Gratuitous gore, contrived plotting... and Ray Winstone's butcher cameo deserves to be filleted.",2/5

5921,Elis,It's an interesting take on the public and personal lives of a national icon.,3.5/5
5922,Elisa & Marcela,"The film is idealistically conceived in setting out to retell a story that had been erased from the history of sexuality. The energy and flair was, however, missing.",2/5
5923,Tropa de Elite (The Elite Squad),"Pois  infinitamente mais recompensador assistir a um filme que estimula a discusso e a auto-anlise do que um que, por covardia ou falta de ambio, limita-se a seguir a corrente do politicamente correto.",5/5
5924,Elite Squad: The Enemy Within,"Embora continuação de uma produção de sucesso, o filme tem aspirações muito mais nobres do que apenas arrancar mais alguns trocados do público.",5/5
5925,Stonehearst Asylum,Edwardian thriller offers formula instead of vision,2/4

5928,Ella Enchanted,uses the archetypal story of Cinderella to skewer convention with that most deadly and effective of weapons: humor,4/5
5929,Elle,Huppert's long-standing genius for expressing complex cocktails of emotions with casual precision is vital to this role.,4/5

5931,Elles,"Juliette Binoche gives it her considerable all in this otherwise dubious film, which purports to investigate the moral and emotional price of teenage prostitution.",2/5
5932,Ellie Parker,"A couple of laughs, a couple of interesting set pieces, a lot of Watts adding to her highlight reel, but when you get right down to it, there's just nothing else.",2/5

5934,Eloise,Generic and painfully ineffective.,1/5

5938,Elvira's Haunted Hills,The campy results make Mel Brooks' Borscht Belt schtick look sophisticated.,2/4
5939,Elvis & Nixon,An imaginative narrative comedy based on the unrecorded meeting between President Nixon and Elvis Presley.,B
5940,Elvis from Outer Space,"The special effects look like they were created on a classroom computer circa 2004, and there are, of course, no actual Elvis songs in the movie.",D
5941,Elvis: That's the Way It Is,"The film was somewhat radically reworked for a TCM special edition; the original is like an old-school monster movie that teases the audience before finally giving fans the spectacle they crave -- Elvis, tearing down the house in all his jumpsuited glory.",3/4
5942,Elysium,"Elysium [is] a brainy sci-fi effort that doesn't skimp on its blockbuster requirements, and delivers one of the most satisfying films of the summer.",B+

5945,Embrace of the Vampire,Just look at the cast and walk quickly past the rental shelf...quickly...,1/5
5946,Emelie,"For much of its brisk eighty-two minutes running time, Emelie (2015) is a devilishly good thriller of notably transgressive bent, giving the slasher and home invasion formats a rare matriarchal focus.",4/5
5947,Emergo (Apartment 143),We are knee-deep in the lazy side of the found footage pool.,2/5
5948,Emma.,"Emma, with all her preening, gossipy self-love, is somehow the perfect Instagram-age heroine. Her actions in this adaptation and with Taylor-Joy's characterisation are not those of a giddy romantic obsessive, but of an unapologetic, empowered woman.",4/5

5950,Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas,The greatest agnostic redneck holiday puppetshow ever devised.,5/5
5951,"Empathy, Inc.","Empathy, Inc.'s greatest special effect is its acting, particularly the four performances at the film's center.",3/5
5952,Emperor,Effectively combines romance with historical fiction about the question of what to do with Emperor Hirohito after the Japanese surrender in 1945.,B
5953,Emperor,[Emperor] re-presents a dark period in American history without being inspired or insightful enough to be worth your curiosity or emotional investment.,1/4
5954,The Emperor's New Clothes,"A minor, offbeat achievement, yet particularly impresses with its strong central performances from a masterly Holm and a sensitive Hjelje.",3/5
5955,The Emperor's New Groove,There's no denying the energy and joy present in this zippy tale.,3/4
5956,The Empire in Africa,Philippe Diaz's tumultuous documentary is a noble but failed attempt to explicate the tragedy of Sierra Leone's 11-year civil war.,2/5

5958,Empire of the Sun,The movie is always interesting from a narrative point of view. Spielberg is a good storyteller with a good tale to tell. But it never really adds up to anything.,2.5/4
5959,Empire Records,"It has a good soundtrack, lots of free-for-all dance scenes, and derision toward aging singers and capitalists. And you just can't get enough of that.",2.5/5
5960,Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back,"The storytelling is the series' best, with a zingy balance of drama, humor, and Deep Thoughts.",A
5961,Employee of the Month,Relentlessly unfunny; Cook and Simpson have a chemistry similar to the combination of bleach and ammonia.,2/10
5962,Empties (Vratné lahve),Sverak's work anchors a cast that delivers a series of delicately executed performances as the actors bring to life a great range of lightly comic characters.,3/4
5963,A Royal Affair,"A Royal Affair is a welcome break from the current plethora of morbid Scandinavian thrillers; instead, Rasmus Heisterberg and Nikolaj Arcel have co-adapted an unfamiliar but well documented true story of 18th century Danish royalty.",3/5
5964,En soap,Christensen joylessly scrubs A Soap clean of sudsy silliness until all that remains is Von Trier-ian starkness.,1.5/4
5965,Enchanted,Enchanted is an enjoyable comedy with several hilarious gags and a genuinely charming performance from Amy Adams. Worth seeing.,3/5
5966,Enchanted April,That's what's appealing about the movie (everyone walks away happy) and also forgettable (everyone walks away mush).,B-
5967,Encino Man,"This is every bit as insipid as it sounds, but it's also surprisingly innocent and has a most unexpected sweetness.",2/4
5968,End Game,Netflix's new documentary End Game is deeply unnerving. It's so matter of fact about life's harshest truth that it can't help but force deep introspection.,3.5/5
5969,The End of America,The End of America gives author and public intellectual Naomi Wolf an Inconvenient Truth-style platform to remind Americans about the Bush administration's assault on our civil liberties.,2.5/4

5972,End of Sentence,"Predominantly set against the backdrop of Ireland, this drama treads a familiar path, and yet still manages to engage with its assured performances and winning balance of heart and humor.",3/5
5973,End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones,"It's hard not to feel that the Ramones, who never had a hit record, were the greatest band in 50 years to be stonewalled out of success.",B+
5974,End of the Spear,A crowd-pleasing entertainment based on the true story of missionaries who ultimately persuaded an indigenous tribe in the Ecuador jungles to stop spearing one another.,B
5975,The End of Violence,"A horrendous, useless, soulless, sprawling two hours of your life you will not get back.",0/5
5976,End of Watch,"As a police drama and especially as a multi-cultural buddy movie, 'End of Watch' makes for exciting fare.",B+

5978,"Endings, Beginnings",It is ultimately a different kind of love story...,C+
5979,Endless,"Even with the familiar foundation, Endless takes the narrative into a completely different direction, one which uses the life-after-death motif to explore the process of dealing with grief in a devastatingly powerful way.",3.5/5
5980,Endless Love,"The movie as a whole does not understand the particular strengths of the novel that inspired it, does not convince us it understands adolescent love, does not seem to know its characters very well, and is a narrative and logical mess.",2/4
5981,Endless Love,Captures the exuberance of adolescents.,B

5984,Endurance,Its mixture of biographical hype and social studies quickly curdles.,2/5
5985,Enduring Love,"Michell's screenplay retains the pretense of McEwan's theories on love, biology, and everything in between, but the transplant is trite and messy.",2/4
5986,Enemies of the People,Leave it to a documentary on the atrocities of a Cambodian genocide to get everything actually right about the way humans store information and retrieve it.,3/4
5987,"Enemies, a Love Story","Enemies: A Love Story is such an intriguing film because it refuses to be tamed, to settle down into a nice, comforting parable with a lesson to teach us. It is about the tumult of the heart, and Mazursky tells its story without compromise.",3.5/4
5988,Enemies Closer,"JCVD may not say it best, but he does say it aptly, when his manically cartoonish baddie caps one murder with the assertion that ""shit happens.""",0.5/4
5989,Enemies of Laughter,An all too apt title for a would-be comedy in which everyone in it and everything about it seems willfully designed to be unfunny.,1/5
5990,Enemy,"Thick with weighty themes, disquieting portent and anxious tension, Villeneuve...crafts a gripping slow burn portrait of the male id/ego, our self-destructive tendencies and how they control us.",A
5991,Enemy at the Gates,It would have been much improved if the filmmakers had shown the courage of Vassilli and jettisoned the familiar subplot and concentrated on the hunter and the hunted.,2.5/4
5992,The Enemy Below,"While recognizing that it's not any sort of great piece of acting by Robert Mitchum or a searing portrait of war, if one accepts The Enemy Below as an action-filled war movie, it's thoroughly entertaining stuff.",4/5
5993,Enemy Lines,"Violent but cliched, unoriginal WWII drama.",2/5
5994,Enemy Mine,It depends on plot gimmicks like the convenient arrival of enemies and the equally convenient arrival of friends to the rescue. It doesn't dare enough.,2.5/4
5995,Enemy of the State,An exciting if often overheated thriller!,3/4
5996,Enemy Territory (Septembers Of Shiraz),"This lifeless, by-the-numbers production is an excruciating exercise in cliche and tedium. Its sole joy is in trying to figure out which of its leads is overacting most.",1/5

6001,The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser (Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle)(Every Man for Himself and God Against All),Kaspar Hauser is one of the purest film examples I know of in which an artist of Romantic sensibility puts society to the test and finds it wanting.,C-

6005,Entanglement,"The script isn't great, but the plot turns and visuals can be striking, and Jess Weixler has fun as the bad-girl sister.",2.5/4
6006,Enter the Anime,Enter the Anime is orientalist at worst and reductionist at best. ...reducing what could have been a documentary to get people involved in the culture to nothing more than a 60-minute ad-roll for Netflix animation.,1/10
6007,Enter the Dangerous Mind,"A smart, stylish psychological thriller boosted by stellar performances and a unique engagement with its schizophrenic protagonist.",3.5/5
6008,Enter the Dragon,A classic of its genre that must be seen by any self-respecting movie buff.,4/5
6009,Enter the Fat Dragon,The star of the Ip Man franchise also delivers witty dialogue with flair and manages to endear a somewhat unlikable character to audiences.,3/5

6024,Equilibrium,Superb production values & Christian Bale's charisma make up for a derivative plot.,3/4
6025,Equity,"I don't know squat about IPOs (if I did, I'd be on my yacht) but I do know a juicy morality play when I see it, and Equity takes us inside modern Wall Street in a unique and gripping manner.",4/5

6027,Erased,"It doesn't entirely insult the intelligence, but often leans towards the indifferent.",2/5
6028,Eraser,"Manages a few solidly entertaining moments, and serves up the kind of meat-and-potatoes action Schwarzenegger's fans have come to expect.",5/10
6029,Eraserhead,...I found this imaginative work to be one of the more interesting films to come out of the '70s.,B+

6037,Ernest Saves Christmas,Is this guy qualified to save an entire holiday?,2/5
6038,Eros,"Three takes on a theme spins a synthetic thread with which to tie together distinctive aesthetic dispositions, but does the package provide particular insight or revelation?",3/5

6042,Escaflowne: The Movie,This beautifully animated epic is never dull.,3/5
6043,Escanaba in da Moonlight,"Stamp is so funny as the dim bulb brother Remnar, and Cain's Reuben is hapless in a deer blind but wants a buck so badly you can truly relate to him and his quest.",3.5/4
6044,Escape and Evasion,A credible and interesting film with compelling ideas.,3/5
6045,Escape Fire: The Fight to Rescue American Healthcare,"A condemnation of the US health system in general, like Michael Moore's Sicko, sans the self-aggrandizing.",3/4
6046,Escape From Alcatraz,"What Mr. Siegel has made is fiction, a first-rate action movie that is about the need and the decision to take action, as well as the action itself.",3/5
6047,John Carpenter's Escape from L.A.,A poetic pulp movie made with joy.,3/4
6048,Escape From Planet Earth,Predictable alien adventure is violent and forgettable.,1/5
6049,Escape from Pretoria,"A testament to the human spirit coupled with sweaty, relentless tension. An intelligent thriller which is more than just another prison escape movie.",4/5
6050,Escape from the Planet of the Apes,"Regarded by some as the best of the Planet of the Apes sequels, maybe even on a par with the 1968 Charlton Heston original itself, this third Apes movie breathes fresh air into [the] series.",3/4
6051,Escape From Tomorrow,"One of the most daring motion pictures I've encountered in a very, very long time. ... An emotionally walloping experience that, for all its flaws, I wouldn't have missed for the world.",9/10
6052,Escape Plan,"For a long stretch of the second act the film feels like doing a long stretch, but Schwarzenegger's having a ball as Stallone goes through the motions.",2/5
6053,Escape Plan 2: Hades,"Stallone's here, kind of, but ""Escape Plan 2"" doesn't have much interest in his participation, going the easy-peasy B-movie route to cough up an inexpensive, easily marketable sequel that's led by actor Xiaoming Huang.",D+
6054,Escape Plan: The Extractors,"The poor quality of Escape Plan 2 meant that I went into Escape Plan 3: The Extractors with serious trepidation, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much fun this turned out to be. It's worth a watch.",3.5/5
6055,Escape Room,"Robitel demonstrates a continued growth as a filmmaker here, and I am hoping there's more Escape Room fun awaiting us in the future...",4/5
6056,Escape to Witch Mountain,hardly the kind of experience that spawns anyone's desire to buy action figures and vibrating brooms,3/5
6057,Essential Killing,"The movie deftly shifts from its initial chase thriller mode to a grueling, offbeat tale of human survival.",3.5/5
6058,Essex Boys,...the sort of unoriginal gangster movie that seems to be far more prevalent now due to the success of fellow Brit directors like Guy Ritchie.,1.5/4
6059,Esteros,"The film works as a drama, as a romance and as, in fact, a biopic of Santiago itself as it comes of age and stands before the camera as a character in its own right.",7/10
6060,Estranged,"The transfixing directorial debut of Adam Levins, ""Estranged"" creates an encroaching sense of imbalance and peril very early on, and doesn't let up until the end credits.",3/4
6061,E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"It works because it touches that (uncritical, non-analytical) childlike part of us that we often need to be reminded is still there.",88/100
6062,Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,Michel Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a comedy that has the bracing fright of an identity-crisis horror film.,3.5/4

6064,Ethan Frome,"Even when you know it is coming, it still takes your breath away.",3/4

6066,Etz Limon (Lemon Tree),Israeli director Eran Riklis's drama boasts a gentle nuance and emotive humour.,3/5
6067,Eulogy,"Little more than a string of jokes stuffed into a contrived storyline, but a lot of the jokes are funny, so maybe it all balances out.",C+
6068,Eulogy for a Vampire,It's hard to imagine anyone watching this attempt at a horror film without guffawing. (Or maybe it's supposed to be a comedy?),1.5/5
6069,Euphoria,It is not simply that this film is utterly unrealistic... What is unforgiveable is that Langseth's approach to complex emotional issues is unsubtle at best and untruthful at worst.,1/4

6073,Eva,Losey puts a political face on both romances and compares them to a cold world bereft of Eden.,C
6074,Eva Hesse,It is odd to watch a documentary where the subject becomes more interesting when she is discussed by other people.,2/4
6075,Evan Almighty,"Will presumably charm wee ones, and...go over like gangbusters with the holy rollers, but others may notice this comedy of faith skimps on the comedy.",2/4
6076,Eve of Destruction,"The movie that introduced Gregory Hines as an action star. (""Running Scared"" was a comedy!)",1/5

6078,Even Dwarfs Started Small (Auch Zwerge haben klein angefangen),Weirdest movie ever.,3/5
6079,Even Money,"Because of the 1985 Ryan O'Neal fiasco, Fever Pitch, Even Money doesn't have the distinction of being the worst film about gambling ever made. Then again, second place is also the first loser.",1/4
6080,The Even Stevens Movie,For hardcore fans of the series only.,1.5/4
6081,Even the Rain (Meme La Pluie),"Subtle the film is not, with Icar Bollan always working extra hard to make sure we don't miss the parallels between the different modes of oppression.",2/4
6082,Evening,Susan Minot's resplendent novel of a dying woman remembering her defining romance with the man who got away stumbles on its way to the screen. Hungarian director Lajos Koltai pushes emotions that need to flow.,2.5/4
6083,The Evening Star,"Sequels are a chancy business at best, but The Evening Star is thin and contrived.",1.5/4
6084,Event Horizon,"A science fiction horror film that is like a meeting of Hellraiser and Alien, albeit without the creativity or thrills.",0.5/4
6085,Ever After: A Cinderella Story,"Romantics will no doubt enjoy Ever After, easily overlooking its flaws. Others who attend will find, while not a perfect film, one which is better than they hoped.",2.5/4
6086,Everest,"I'm an explorer myself, but take my advice, if you have any aspirations of seeing Everest - do it in a movie theater.",3.5/4
6087,Everest,"Its screenwriters ... have Gladiator and 127 Hours to their names, and Everest combines the muscular, sometimes sentimental force of the former with the sense of physical endurance that made the latter so successful.",4/5
6088,Evergreen,The kind of low-budget independent movie that you see hoping for greatness -- and you leave a little let down.,1.5/4
6089,Evergreen: The Road to Legalization in Washington,The lack of suspense results in something like a one-sided pat on the back for everyone involved.,B
6090,Everlasting,"Everlasting is a remarkable film that's perhaps a little too understated and low budget to be on the mainstream's radar, but for those able to check it out will be greatly rewarded.",8/10
6091,An Everlasting Piece,All attempts at comedy seem to have been swept under the rug in a movie that at best could be called intermittently whimsical.,4/10
6092,Everly,"""Everly"" is effective and gore-soaked and occasionally shocking. And when it plays to packed audiences, it's easy to imagine them whooping in agreement.",B
6093,Every Act of Life,"Ultimately however, Every Act of Life too frequently veers into overly romanticized terrain...",5/10
6094,Ever Again,"What makes this movie worth seeing, is, ironically, exactly what may deter potential audiences: It's a rigorous, almost academic examination of a venomous hatred rooted in the past, primed to poison the future.",2.5/4
6095,Every Day,"An uneven look at modern family in crisis. Stay awake during the slow stretches, the good footage is worth it.",7/10
6096,Every Day,"It all adds up to a movie far more enjoyable than the premise suggests, and particularly so for the teenaged audience at whom it's no doubt targeted.",3.5/5
6097,Every Little Step,An immensely entertaining documentary about dancers performing in a grueling New York City audition for roles in a revival of A Chorus Line.,3/5
6098,Every Man for Himself (Sauve qui peut (la vie)),Is Godard the prostitute or the pimp?,3.5/4
6099,Every Secret Thing,"Pitched somewhere between a David Fincher crime procedural, a Denis Lehane suspense novel and a Mommie Dearest melodrama, documentarian Amy Berg's move into the feature-length world of dramatic narrative is...an uneven one.",B-
6100,Every Thing Will Be Fine,"Every Thing Will Be Fine is a title meant to put you at ease, but a movie that'll likely put you to sleep.",4/10
6101,Every Time I Die,"The best no-budget indie thriller of the summer, maybe of the year.",3/4
6102,Every Which Way But Loose,"...probably the single most mediocre film Eastwood ever made, but the public loved it...",5/10
6103,Everybody Knows (Todos lo saben),"The Spanish-language drama ""Everybody Knows,"" is not a bad movie. In fact, it's half-decent, but the problem is we've come to expect much more from him.",C+
6104,Everybody Knows... Elizabeth Murray,"Despite the compact running time, it is easy to feel that you have come to know-and likely admire-Elizabeth Murray.",3/4
6105,Everybody Loves Somebody,"A romantic comedy in which humor and romance flow with in a natural way, it's not silly or corny. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
6106,Everybody Wants Some!!,"Everybody Wants Some brilliantly, and hilariously, uses sexuality to mask the film's more dominant and profound theme - living with passion.",9/10
6107,Everybody Wants to Be Italian,Has more the feeling of a TV serial than a well-structured movie.,C+
6108,Everybody's All-American,"By the end of the film, we not only feel we know these people -- we feel we know them too well and would like to make some new friends.",2/4
6109,Everybody's Famous!,This pathetic shaggy-dog tale is a picture only a mother could love.,D
6110,Everyday,"This is a strange and stirring film, which combines a Malick-ish concern with the emotional import of nature with a rare charm and levity. Everyday is a red letter treat.",4/5
6111,Everyday Sunshine: The Story of Fishbone,Makes a convincing case for Fishbone as underrecognized pioneers of a multicultural mash-up esthetic...,3/4
6112,Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out,"Everyone Stares is an unprecedented look at the brief career of one of rock's all-time greatest acts, but disappoints more than it illuminates.",2.5/5
6113,Everyone's Hero,Everyone's Hero re-creates Depression-era America with surprisingly agreeable anachronistic panache.,B-
6114,"Everything, Everything",An original -- surprise -- teen romance concept that fails spectacularly at the climax. Terrific performances from two young actors are all that make this worth it.,2/5
6115,Everything is Illuminated,"Maybe it's me, but I prefer my quirky comedies without a side of Holocaust.",3/5
6116,Everything Must Go,...Ferrell's personable and charismatic performance certainly [proves] instrumental in initially capturing the viewer's interest.,2.5/4
6117,Everything Strange and New,"The images are sometimes heavy-handed, and the same can be said of the film as a whole.",2/4
6118,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask,"One of Woody's slightest efforts, to be sure, but it still delivers a healthy batch of laughs.",4/5
6119,Everything's Cool,"I really liked this film more than I did An Inconvenient Truth, as Everything's Cool made the subject matter into a palatable form that actually made it interesting instead of depressing.",4/5
6120,Eve's Bayou,"This is a first outing as a writer and director by actress Kasi Lemmons, and damn, what an excellent start.",4.5/5
6121,Evidence,The evidence here merely suggests that the only things more indestructible than horror-movie fiends are the tired tropes their sagas employ.,2/5
6122,Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn,"If you know it's all special effects, and if you've seen a lot of other movies and have a sense of humor, you might have a great time at Evil Dead 2.",3/4
6123,Evil Little Things,"Evil Little Things steps to the plate with three anthological chances to hit ""creepy dolly horror"" out of the park, but whiffs every time like a blind designated hitter.",1/5
6124,The Evil of Frankenstein,It's only the solid professional acting ability of Peter Cushing as Baron Frankenstein that gives this pic any credibility.,C
6125,Evil Under the Sun,"There are delicious moments in the final fifteen minutes of Evil Under The Sun, but what I especially liked about this Christie were the opening scenes the setup.",3/4
6126,Evilspeak,So outrageous it's great fun.,3/5
6127,Evita,"The problem is that Madonna's performance is all style. She mugs for the camera, but her acting is rarely convincing and her songs are one disappointment after another.",2/4
6128,Évocateur: The Morton Downey Jr. Movie,The Mouth's dubious legacy and his many off-camera complications are examined with a coarse affection of which he himself would surely approve.,3/5
6129,Evolution,The hands-off atmosphere is perpetuated by an ongoing emphasis on cryptic elements...,1/4
6130,Ex Drummer,"Ex Drummer is a mess of a film, a tawdry, bizarre tale that has enough visual style to set it apart, barely, from being a complete waste of several hours of your life.",D-
6131,Ex Machina,"Anchored by three dazzling central performances, it's a stunning directorial debut from Alex Garland that's essential viewing for anyone with even a passing interest in where technology is taking us.",9/10
6132,Exam,"Without any real depth, the whole thing feels somewhat pointless.",2.5/5
6133,Examined Life,"A hugely successful and provocative attempt at elevating the tone of public discussion, and inviting some great minds along to help smooth the bumpy ride ahead of us all in 2009.",3/4
6134,Excalibur,The film based on La Morte D'Arthur by Thomas Malory does actually remind one of passages from that novel. Poetic.,4/4
6135,Excess Baggage,"[Silverstone is] OK in it, but no better than OK. Benicio Del Toro steals it with his performance as a car thief who becomes an unwilling kidnapper.",3/4
6136,Excision,Excision is a supremely nasty piece of work in the best way possible.,B+
6137,Excuse Me for Living,"Is it a comedy if the audience laughs or is it a comedy if laughs were intended, irrespective of whether they're generated? ""Excuse Me for Living"" qualifies under the second definition.",2/4
6138,Executive Action,This is essentially a dramatized rewrite of all those old assassination conspiracy books.,2/4
6139,Executive Suite,"Glossy, star packed drama with Holden in top form.",5/5
6140,Exhibition,A skillfully assembled portrait of an artistic couple who are preparing to sell their impressive London home.,4/5
6141,Fong juk (Exiled),...heavy on style but disappointingly low on substance.,2/4
6142,Existenz,Cronenberg slides between reality and virtual reality with such seamless morphing that it is sometimes intentionally unclear what world the characters are in.,8/10
6143,Exists,"Bigfoot lives, but every other element in Exists is DOA.",2.5/4
6144,Exit Plan (Selvmords turisten),"A film that is initially captivating, but that is solved in an unconvincing way. [Full Review in Spanish]",2.5/5
6145,Exit Through The Gift Shop,"Every bit as quirky, engaging and rebellious as the artwork it aims to celebrate. Sadly, it also shares graffiti's tendency to be energetic but scattergun and ephemeral.",3/5
6146,Exit Wounds,"While not what one would exactly call 'action-packed,' there are several scenes that are edited and directed with such energy, it's a shame the rest of the movie is so very bad.",1.5/4
6147,Exodus: Gods and Kings,"Ridley Scott has delivered a different kind of Biblical epic, one that questions just as much as it glorifies the power of the Almighty as He destroys the scourge who has taken more than their pound of flesh from ""God's Chosen People"".",4/5
6148,The Exorcism of Emily Rose,"Carpenter shrieks and snarls, Wilkinson frets piously, and Linney knits her brows, but all in such a reverent way that the necessary emotional fireworks never ignite",2/5
6149,The Exorcist,"At once an honest, disturbing exploration of the darker aspects of religion and the spiritual world, it is also an unabashed horror movie",4/4
6150,The Exorcist III,Not as good as The Exorcist but a masterpiece compared to The Heretic,2.5/4
6151,Exorcist II: The Heretic,How could such a sure-thing sequel end up so absolutely atrocious? I've no idea.,1/5
6152,Exorcist: The Beginning,"It never approaches the stratospheric badness of Exorcist II: The Heretic, but this lemon does its damndest to heap more dirt on the franchise's grave.",1.5/4
6153,Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed,A cynical attempt to sucker Christian conservatives into thinking they're losing the 'intelligent design' debate because of academic 'prejudice.',1/5
6154,Experiment in Terror,Superior thriller from before Edwards' typecasting as a comedy specialist.,4/5
6155,Experiment Perilous,Splendid period thriller from Tourneur. Deserves to be better known.,4/5
6156,Experimenter,"Ultimately, Experimenter finds a glimmer of hope by simply revealing itself. Maybe if more people are educated about the dangers of obedience, they'll put up more resistance. It can't hurt to hope.",4/5
6157,Expired,The movie forces us to endure so much meanness without a proper resolution at the end of it. It's all ordeal and no payoff.,C-
6158,Explicit Ills,"A film that wants to speak out (loudly and clearly) about some of our nation's most obvious maladies, and it does so in an impressively honest, angry, and semi-hopeful fashion.",4/5
6159,The Exploding Girl,A slow and tedious look at the emotional aimlessness of college kids leaves the audience without either direction or entertainment.,5/10
6160,Explorers,A fun-time nostalgic trip into outer space.,3.5/5
6161,Exporting Raymond,"This frequently hilarious documentary (no talking heads, thank goodness) shows that Phil Rosenthal, the creator of 'Everybody Loves Raymond,' is funnier than Ray Romano, its star.",B+
6162,Exposed,"""Exposed"" is a mess and completely forgettable, but perhaps it's more interesting as a lost movie, with its true form caught between the demands of its financier and the vision of its original creator.",D
6163,Exterminating Angels,"Exterminating Angels is Jean-Claude Brisseau's Sex is Comedy, though it could just as easily have been called Anatomy of Hell.",3/4
6164,The Exterminator,D-grade Death Wish leech.,1/5
6165,Extinction,It very much feels like it's trying too hard to be a grand and serious work while at the same time using some of the most hoary and overripe tropes of the genre to make its points.,C-
6166,Extinction,"Extinction would have been a much more enjoyable experience had it distinguished itself in its early going, as opposed to its back half.",D
6167,The Extra Man,More an exhibition of precious acting than an absorbing narrative.,B-
6168,Extraction,"Very low-rent with a phoned-in Bruce Willis performance. However, director Steven C. Miller and game stars Gina Carano and Kellan Lutz contribute a few solid action scenes.",4/10
6169,Extraction,"Featuring some of the most exhilarating & ambitious action sequences & fight choreography since John Wick, Extraction is an outstanding directorial debut.",4/5
6170,Extracurricular,"It's fast paced, witty and sometimes sexy, a seductive package with a deceptively smart core and one of the best offerings for young audiences.",4/5
6171,Extraordinary Measures,Even moviegoers with a soft spot for uplifting family drama will have a hard time sitting through this one.,2/5
6172,Extraordinary Tales,It offers a CliffsNotes encapsulation of Edgar Allen Poe's most enduring works for viewers unacquainted with them.,2/4
6173,Extraterrestrial,"Extraterrestrial is, in the final analysis, nothing short of a disaster.",1.5/4
6174,Extraterrestrial,"[It doesn't] further the alien sub-genre, which as far as I'm concerned, is dead.",2.5/5
6175,Extreme Measures,Is it excusable to kill a few indigents here and there experimenting for a miracle cure? Measures' painfully protracted Hour 2 turns into a melodramatic debate about ethics.,2/4
6176,Extreme Ops,"Poor editing, bad bluescreen, and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action.",1/4
6177,Extreme Prejudice,"Walter Hill is the right director for this material. He specializes in male action movies where the characters are all a little taller, leaner, meaner and more obscene than in real life.",3/4
6178,An Extremely Goofy Movie,Definitely a cut above most straight-to-tape family fodder.,3/4
6179,Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close,"A cloying exercise in sentimentality, the film also winds up extremely annoying, even infuriating.",2/4
6180,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile","Extremely callous treatment of source material, hopelessly confused between presenting Bundy's or another's perspective, wasting incredible performances by Zac Efron and Lily Collins",C+
6181,Extremities,Not much insight here.,2/5
6182,Extremity,Extremity displays a determination to do things differently and an assuredness and confidence that sets it apart.,8/10
6183,Eye for an Eye,This movie is intellectually corrupt because it deliberately avoids dealing with the issues it raises.,1/4
6184,Eye for an Eye (Quien a hierro mata),Leaves you breathless. [Full review in Spanish],3.5/5
6185,Eye In The Sky,"Eye in the Sky presents a talented ensemble of differing perspectives on the controversial use of drone missiles, forcing us to confront our own feelings about the complicated implications of modern warfare.",9/10
6186,Eye of the Dolphin,"Carly Schroeder is strong and the film's genuineness compensates for the 'after school special'-style script and production values, making it a pleasant, even uplifting film.",73/100
6187,Eye of the Needle,A great thriller; Sutherland is tops and Nelligan is steely.,4/5
6188,Eyes of Laura Mars,Pulpy and dramatic mystery-thriller.,2.5/5
6189,The Eyes of Tammy Faye,"She lived in comfort, and still does. But the movie tacitly implies that she didn't do anything criminal, that what you saw on TV was the real Tammy Faye, all of her, with no hidden edges or secrets.",3/4
6190,Eyes Wide Shut,"To us, Eyes Wide Shut brought great disappointment.",2/4
6191,Eyes Without a Face,This marvelously bizarre film was a chilling mixture of art and schlock.,A
6192,F,"Pulsing, paranoid and downright eerie, this is a hoodie thriller with proper scares John Carpenter would be proud of.",4/5
6193,F for Fake,"Welles, here in his sixties, reveals two new sides to his cinema audience, the prankster and the editor.",4/4
6194,A Face in the Crowd,"A little overdone, but Neal and Remick are brilliant.",4/5
6195,Face to Face,"For a film that is still mostly just people in a room talking -- and more importantly, for a low-budget Australian drama, a category that often rings alarm bells -- Face to Face impresses in just about every way.",4/5
6196,Face/Off,It could be argued that this movie's callousness toward human life is nihilistic and nasty. But Woo takes everything so absurdly far that audiences laugh at what horrified them moments before.,3.5/4
6197,Faces,"[A] rambling and ultimately uninspired film, intentionally made to look cheap and lacking in much resolution.",2.5/5
6198,Faces in the Crowd,...the novel premise and Jovovich's strong performance almost manage to compensate for the pervasively uneven atmosphere.,2/4
6199,"Faces Places (Visages, villages)","A treat for art fans and cinephiles fond of French film history, the whimsy and wisdom of ""Faces, Places"" is certain to win over a new generation of Agnes Varda and JR fans.",B+
6200,Facing the Giants,The religious proselytizing in this football movie is about as subtle as a blindside hit by a 300-pound defensive end.,2/4
6201,Facing Windows,"Filtered through the unsparing prism of history, it's a unique and powerful portrait of a marriage.",3.5/5
6202,Factory Girl,"Miller is undeniably engaging. That's probably not enough to save the movie from obscurity, but it should, at the very least, guarantee bigger and better things for its star.",3/4
6203,Factotum,"The script excerpts the writer's poetry and prose sparingly and to good effect, Dillon's gravelly delivery full of an instinctive, deep feel for language.",3/5
6204,The Faculty,What could have been an interesting update of Body Snatchers for the teen crowd becomes a very bland Robert A. Heinlein's The Breakfast Club.,1/5
6205,Fading Of The Cries,A lame-brained zombies + evil wizards hybrid.,1.5/5
6206,Fading Gigolo,Turturro has given Allen his biggest and best on-screen turn in years: the part was written for him and it's full of scope for aimble kvetching and nimble slapstick.,4/5
6207,Fados,What Fados lacks in jaw-dropping sexiness it makes up for in casual sensuality.,3/4
6208,Fagara (Huajiao zhiwei),"The movie succeeds, mostly because of the degree of care taken with each woman's background, which is rooted in concerns peculiar to their age, class and society.",3.5/5
6209,Fahrenheit 11/9,"Few can match Moore's gift for agitprop mischief when he's in this mood, and things build to an apocalyptic crescendo, complete with warnings of authoritarianism, armed insurrection, and even nuclear war.",4/5
6210,Fail-Safe,Wow! One of the scariest black and white films of all time.,5/5
6211,Failure to Launch,"A nice premise with poignant sociological foundation (adult children living with parents) gets a crude treatment in this romantic comedy, which suffers from repetitive structure and lack of stylishness considering its caliber of stars.",2/5
6212,Fair Game,"With first-rate performances from Sean Penn and Naomi Watts and a compelling script, this suspenseful, taut drama should keep audiences nailed to their seats.",4/5
6213,Fairy Tale: A True Story,"The movie works as a fantasy, and as a story of little girls who fascinate two of the most famous men of the age -- Conan Doyle and the magician Harry Houdini, an outspoken debunker of all forms of spiritualism.",3/4
6214,Faith Connections,A slick yet mostly tedious documentary that runs nearly two hours without getting much beyond a tourist's point of view.,1.5/5
6215,Faith Of Our Fathers,A latter-day variation on the Prodigal Son parable providing proof that God still works in mysterious ways.,3/4
6216,Faithful,"If I had Diabolique and Faithful in theaters simultaneously, I'd hire a hit man to take myself out.",1.5/4
6217,Fake It So Real,"An entertaining documentary portrait of the barely professional, essentially hobbyist wrestling scene in Lincolnton, North Carolina -- a scene replicated in scores of American communities, where wannabe Rocks battle on YouTube and in tiny veteran centers.",3/4
6218,The Falcon and the Snowman,Fresh and invigorating political thriller.,4/5
6219,Falcon Rising,"It's a straightforward vengeance tale with no other ambition than to entertain. That said, it has something.",2.5/4
6220,Fall Down Dead,Another serial killer movie...and this one's so bad it reaffirms how often we take even mediocre pictures for granted.,0/4
6221,The Fall of Fujimori,Thorough and fascinating.,3.5/5
6222,The Fall of the Roman Empire,An above average epic.,B
6223,Fall to Grace,Here are 12 people. Here are their 12 problems. Here are 12 solutions. World peace. The end.,1.5/4
6224,Fallen (Falling),Meanders forward with little apparent direction and virtually no interesting drama.,2/4
6225,Fallen,"In its strongest moments, the film plays like ill-conceived fan fiction, but for the most part is wafer-thin, nonsensical and laborious to watch.",0.5/5
6226,The Fallen Idol,Graham Greene liked to say that he preferred The Fallen Idol (1948) to the more famous The Third Man (1949) because it was more a writer's film than a director's.,4/5
6227,Falling Angels,...surprisingly moving and emotional.,3/4
6228,Falling Down,"Falling Down is a brutally manipulative revenge fantasy, a piece of comic-strip demagoguery that teeters uneasily on the brink of satire.",C
6229,Falling from Grace,Surprisingly good movie. One of the few rock stars to get it right.,4/5
6230,Falling in Love,It was either this or watch paint dry,2/5
6231,Falling Inn Love,"If nothing else, Falling Inn Love offers 100 minutes of respite from the rest of the world.",2.5/5
6232,Falling Overnight,Recalls some of the more annoying entries in the mumblecore subgenre that erroneously believe that every indiscriminate moment in a person's life is worthy of a film regardless of subtext.,1/4
6233,Fame,Alan Parker manages to make this a fairly horrible story even while it remains entertaining.,4/5
6234,Fame-ish,Fame-ish is an entertaining hodgepodge.,2.5/5
6235,Family Business,"All of the scenes establishing the characters and setting up the caper are joyful to watch, mostly because of the rich comic exaggerations of the Connery character.",3/4

6237,The Family Man,The best date movie of the year.,9/10
6238,Family Plot,"While it's certainly not up to the standard of Hitchcock's great films, Family Plot is still good fun.",73/100
6239,"Family Romance, LLC","A strange, faintly frustrating but diverting film.",3/5
6240,The Family Stone,A funny and emotionally resonant family drama about the value of seeing everyone as a work in progress and transcending our provisional and limited judgments of them.,4/5
6241,A Family Thing,"It's likely to be overrated by some and underrated by others, and both contingents will be wrong. One can't, however, overrate the performances, with auntie ruling the roost in more ways than one.",3/4
6242,Family Weekend,"What Emily wants is basically a return to ""Leave it to Beaver"" sort of values. That may be a hard sell in the 21st Century.",7/10
6243,Famous Nathan,"There's a lot to chew on in this family-centered documentary, but the wonderful archival footage of Coney Island adds enough garnish to justify the time.",3/5
6244,Fanboys,What I expected to be a big fat mess of a movie turned out to be pretty dang fun -- quadruply so if you happen to be a Star Wars fanatic.,3.5/5

6246,Fando y Lis (Fando and Lis),A cross between Luis Bunuel and John Waters.,4/4

6248,"Fanny, Annie & Danny","""Fanny, Annie & Danny"" may be an unpleasant story about unpleasant characters, but the acting is fabulous.",3/5
6249,Fantasia 2000,"As the first theatrical release designed exclusively for IMAX screens, it fills the eyes of the audience with splendor.",5/5
6250,Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"A worthy, but much different, successor to Harry Potter.",7/10
6251,Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"The second chapter in JK Rowling's five-part story, it's a film stuffed with characters, big moments and impressive spectacle but still feels bizarrely underpowered.",3/5

6253,Fantastic Four,Maybe the Fantastic Four just aren't meant for a live-action movie.,5/10
6254,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"The best thing about this naive, corny sequel, which is only slighly better-produced than the original, is its brevity.",C
6255,Fantastic Planet,"If there ever was a film that needed to be experienced in order to be appreciated, this is it. Reading critics' words about it just does not do it justice.",3.5/4
6256,Fantastic Voyage,"The once revolutionary special effects not merely pales in comparison to many of today's offerings, but looks downright silly.",2/4
6257,Fantasy Island,"There's a degree of strain and tedium in the effort to convince us the story ultimately makes sense. Perhaps Wadlow's next project, Magic 8-Ball, will be his breakthrough. For the moment, however, his fantasy of making a good movie remains unfulfilled.",2.5/5
6258,Far and Away,"There is a lot of stuff here -- bustles, hats, lace, gowns, Robert Prosky, top hats, carriages, and a really grand long shot of the Oklahoma land rush -- but you take it all away and you're left with something like Blue Lagoon.",2/5
6259,Far From Heaven,"Underneath all of the stylization that Haynes employs, we realize little has fundamentally changed today, and when that happens any of the ironic distance that we felt early on disintegrates completely.",4/4
6260,Far From Home - The Adventures Of Yellow Dog,"It says nothing you have not heard before, but it is a simple, sweet, and life affirming show to watch.",2/4
6261,Far from Men,"""Far From Men"" never strays far from its western genre roots, except perhaps in its ultimate subtle moral: Nothing, not honor, duty or your personal code, is so important that it trumps the value of your life.",B+
6262,Far From the Madding Crowd,"With dashing redcoats, picturesque bucolic vistas and heaving bosoms aplenty, there is more than enough in Danish director Thomas Vinterberg's gorgeous adaptation of Thomas Hardy's classic novel to treat any lingering Poldark withdrawal symptoms.",5/5
6263,Far From the Tree,All of the families in Far From the Tree are compelling - their trials unimaginable and their spirits indomitable. You'll want to have a box of Kleenex handy.,B+
6264,Far Out Isn't Far Enough: The Tomi Ungerer Story,"Ungerer is certainly an irrepressible force, but beyond his surreal erotica getting him blacklisted from picture books in the early '70s, his life isn't very dramatic, and Bernstein's film pads it with historical footage and precious animations.",3/5
6265,Farewell (L'affaire Farewell),Farewell is engaging but primarily at the level of human emotion. The big political stuff doesn't quite adhere.,3.5/5
6266,"Farewell, Herr Schwarz",A bittersweet documentary detailing an attempt to reconcile a pair of siblings' polar opposite approaches to surviving the Holocaust.,4/4
6267,"Farewell, My Queen",An exquisite French costume drama about the early days of the French revolution and a servant girl at Versailles who sees it all.,4/5
6268,A Farewell to Arms,Read the book,2/5
6269,Farewell to the King,"What is most interesting about Farewell to the King is its impulse to tell this story at all. It could so easily have become ridiculous, or merely violent, but Milius keeps edging back toward the philosophy of his hero.",3/4
6270,Fargo,"The joy of Fargo is that everything that goes wrong does so in a perfectly realized universe of icebound Minnesotan understatement, a landscape so muffled by snow and Scandinavian-bred, low-affect courtesy that even murderous passion comes out goofy.",A
6271,Farinelli,Musically thrilling.,4/5
6272,Farmageddon,A worthy addition to the growing annals of movies and books advocating for sustainable farming methods.,3/4
6273,Farming,"It's a hell of a story, but left me feeling that Akinnuoye-Agbaje - who also appears as his own father, and performs roughly half of the songs on the soundtrack - was perhaps too close to the subject to tell it with the clarity it demands.",2/5
6274,POV,"Hate crimes, racial tensions, economic strife, illegal immigration, and the preservation of white neighborhoods are familiar issues in this nation, but the crux of the documentary Farmingville is where these issues play out.",3.5/5
6275,Farmland,"""Farmland"" is essentially just masquerading as an actual documentary. In reality, it's a glossy corporate infomercial for American agribusiness.",0.5/4
6276,Farscape: The Peacekeeper Wars,"""Farscape"" has always been one of the most visually creative and beautiful shows on television, now with more money to throw around it is positively glowing.",4/5

6278,The Ex,Everything that can go wrong with a comedy like this does.,1.5/5
6279,Fast & Furious,Enough with the brooding and the emoting. What Fast & Furious needs more than anything is some hint that the people involved know how ridiculous it is.,2/4
6280,Fast & Furious 6,"Furious 6, like its predecessors, is a big screen no-brainer that's objectively terrible but undeniably pleasurable.",3/5
6281,Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw,"This is probably the best Fast & Furious movie of them all. It's easily the most humorous and consistently entertaining, and it functions as more of a standalone film than anything since Tokyo Drift.",7/10
6282,The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift,"A high-test wet dream for the teenage mentality, but with a pay off of something new on the action movie circuit.",3/5
6283,"Fast, Cheap & Out of Control",demonstrates that [Morris] continues to find fascinating subject matter outside the mainstream,B+
6284,Fast Color,"It's not a superhero movie by any standard definition, but Ruth's journey is a heroic one all the same.",B
6285,Fast Company,"A solid little ""B"" movie that crosses the finish line.",3.5/4

6296,Fat City,"An insightful, humanist masterwork.",4/4
6297,Fat Girl,"Well acted and directed, with honest, gutsy performances from the young leads and a telling eye for the little details that mean so much.",3/5
6298,Fat Girls,Plays with the conventions of the teen genre while making the most of its low-budget indie roots,3.5/5
6299,Fat Kid Rules the World,"Jacob Wysocki delivers an impressive character transformation from an almost insufferable sad sack to a powerhouse capable, and confident, enough to indeed rule his own world.",4.5/5
6300,Fat Man and Little Boy,"Fat Man and Little Boy is a fiction based on the Manhattan Project, but it is thin and unfocused and hardly even suggests the enormous moral and practical questions that the scientists wrestled with in the New Mexico desert.",1.5/4
6301,"Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead","Joe Cross asks fellow fatties to lose the avoirdupois, interviewing people on the street and taking action in an amusing weigh.",B

6303,Father (Father: Diary of One Week),A visually audacious yet highly personal study of the uneasy relationship between postwar Hungary and its past.,4/5
6304,Father of Invention,"An effort drawn to mediocrity, ignoring wonderful comedic opportunities to make yet another relationship story between a humiliated father and his distrustful daughter.",C
6305,Father Figures,A comedy that doesn't go for cheap laughs is commendable. A comedy that doesn't go for any laughs at all is inexplicable.,1/4
6306,Father Goose,"an immensely amusing tale, with a great Grant performance",4/5
6307,Father Hood,"Father Hood is a genial, simple-minded chase picture in which a small time thief learns to love his children. I didn't believe a single second of it, although I enjoyed a few of them.",1/4
6308,The Father of My Children (Le pere de mes enfants),"Impressively directed and superbly written, this is an emotionally engaging drama with terrific performances from real life father and daughter Louis-Do and Alice de Lencquesaing.",4/5
6309,Father of the Bride: Part II,"Father of the Bride Part II is not a great movie and not even as good as its 1991 inspiration (not to mention the Spencer Tracy-Elizabeth Taylor original from 1950). But it is warm and fuzzy, and has some good laughs and a lot of sweetness.",2.5/4
6310,Father of the Year,"You won't hate the experience of watching it, but you'll forget you saw it before it's even over.",1.5/4
6311,Fathers And Daughters,An A-list guilty pleasure.,3/5
6312,Fathers' Day,"No masterpiece but undeniably heavy on laughs, the movie is put over by the buffed, lubricated dynamics of two leads who substantially transcend what is otherwise a borderline tepid dose of family values.",3/4
6313,Father's Day,"I'd take it over many of the high-profile attempts at grindhouse horror and it's even more remarkable when one considers that the legendary company gave Astron-6 $10,000 to make it. I'm slightly terrified to think of what they could do with $10 million.",3.5/5
6314,Father's Little Dividend,It is not very often that the sequel to a successful film turns out to be even half as successful or rewarding as the original picture was.,4/5
6315,Fatima,An inspired retelling of a century old story of a miracle in a small town in Portugal in 1917 has remarkable relevance for this year of a worldwide pandemic and the need to believe.,3.5/5
6316,Faults,"Writer-director Riley Stearns shows promise, but his feature debut never comes together the way it should.",C+
6317,Faust,His Faust is a bit too detached to be truly disturbing or emotionally affecting.,3/4
6318,Favela Rising,"An uplifting story that's well worth telling, but the directors rather lose sight of the wider sociological ramifications to iconise a figurehead whose courage is couched in almost miraculous terms.",3/5
6319,The Favor,The ending of the film is appalling.,2/4
6320,Fay Grim,Everybody's trying too hard--or not hard enough,2/4
6321,Fear and Desire,"If Fear and Desire is uneven and sometimes reveals an experimental rather than a polished exterior, its over-all effect is entirely worthy of the sincere effort put into it.",3/5
6322,Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,"They set out to do a straight adaptation of the book, and they did--and go figure, it worked.",4/5
6323,Fear City,Hit-or-miss cult director Abel Ferrara missed by a city mile on this one.,C
6324,"Fear, Inc.",[Fear Inc.] seems tailor-made for genre junkies in search of a film aware of all the in-jokes... except for how to make them particularly clever.,2/5
6325,Fear No Evil,Dry demonic possession-in-high school stuff.,1.5/5
6326,Angst Essen Seele auf (Ali: Fear Eats the Soul),"Ali: Fear Eats the Soul might sound like improbable, contrived soap opera. It doesn't play that way.",4/4

6337,Feel the Beat,"While predictable, Feel the Beat is a solid effort in the family genre arena for Netflix. It's a tween recipe for success.",3.5/5
6338,Feel the Noise,A horrid excuse for teen escapism...for those who find Hannah Montana too challenging.,F
6339,Feeling Minnesota,One bad screenwriting decision after another; it could be taught in film school as an example of what to avoid.,1/5

6345,Female Perversions,Streitfeld is only fitfully successful.,2/4
6346,Female Trouble,"John Waters' most bizarre work is also his worst, a nonsensical palette of disgusting characters, bad acting, a baffling plot, and just plain bad taste.",1/5
6347,The Shrine,"The Shrine builds and builds and builds, until it finally shows just what it is made of.",3/5
6348,Feminists: What Were They Thinking?,"A sprawling, almost over-reaching (considering its 85 minute running time) and optimistic look at American feminists, then and now, old and young.",3/4
6349,Fences,"If you want to see some great acting, Fences is a movie that has great acting.",8/10
6350,Feral,"Well-acted, and a solid example of how to build tension by first creating characters the audience can get invested in.",3/4
6351,Feral,Annapurna Sriram is excellent and Andrew Wonder combines an experimental narrative with some intimate direction.,3/4

6356,Festival Express,"A clever look at the period, even if it does slightly sidestep the politics.",3/5

6384,Filly Brown,"Almost despite our will, the cast keeps us invested in Filly's furious resurrection.",3.5/5
6385,Film Geek,"Westby makes excellent use of Portland locations and cinematic references to make Film Geek a mostly spot-on, sometimes hilarious character study.",B+
6386,Film Stars Don't Die in Liverpool,"Improbably, while Annette Bening is incredible playing a fading Hollywood starlet in Paul McGuigan's ""Film Stars Don't Die In Liverpool,"" it's her co-star, Jamie Bell, who might be the film's real secret weapon.",B
6387,A Film Unfinished,A documentary record of the ghastly conditions existing in the Nazi-occupied Warsaw Ghetto in 1942.,B

6415,Finding Fela!,Something to be excited about!,4/5
6416,Finding Forrester,"Finding Forrester is a positive experience, a movie you can sit back and enjoy. It will make you laugh, anger you at times, and may even bring a tear to your eye. It's a movie that may envelop you like a warm hug.",3.5/4
6417,Finding Kim,"Although it's simple in structure and transition stories are increasingly common as a subject, this film rises above the competition through a combination of excellent technical work and sensitivity towards Kim as a person.",4/5

6424,A Fine Mess,...a thoroughly ludicrous but strangely enjoyable piece of work.,2.5/4
6425,Fingers,To see Fingers is to see Keitel perform as if he's doing dramatic improv. And that's absolutely fine as it is.,3.5/5
6426,Finian's Rainbow,An inauspicious early Coppola film of a muscial that was already dated by the time the cameras rolled.,2/5

6428,Fire at Sea (Fuocoammare),"The film provides no commentary, no text or context, it just shows.",5/5
6429,Fire Birds,"The actors try hard, but only Jones manages anything approaching sympathy; Cage seems to be doing a bizarre John Agar imitation and Young is terribly miscast.",1/4

6438,Firelight,"Though sometimes predictable, Nicholson's film is sustained by the quality of his writing, especially the musings about the magical powers of firelight, by the almost surreal lake house scenes and by the scoring of Christopher Gunning.",4/5

6471,Fist of Legend (Jing wu ying xiong),"If you're going remake a film, it should be better than (or at least different from) the original. And surprisingly, Fist of Legend manages to do just that.",3.5/4
6472,A Fistful of Dollars (Per un Pugno di Dollari),"Really little more than a series of loosely connected shoot-outs -- but, as Sergio Leone proved, there can be a lot of fun in that.",3/4
6473,Fists Of Legend,"The film is so generous in its characterizations that it's easy to overlook the fact that its hot-topic drama (bullying, economic marginalization, etc.) amounts to little more than padded lip service.",2/4

6480,Five Graves to Cairo,Scores on every level.,4.5/5
6481,The Five Heartbeats,"This is not only a biography with music, but also a thoughtful look at the way five young men from a poor but nurturing black neighborhood find success, and deal with it.",3/4
6482,Five Nights in Maine,"Five nights in Maine suffers from an uneventful and thoroughly subdued feel that does, particularly as time progresses, render its positive attributes moot.",2.5/4
6483,Five Star,"In the end, it reduces public-housing dwellers to the same stock roles they occupy in less thoughtful films, limiting their stories rather than allowing them to develop.",2.5/4
6484,Five Star Day,"Isn't an exceptional feature, but its sensitivity and dedication to the comfort of strangers is quite appealing. It tenders a sweet message about human attachment and kindness, creating a gentle ambiance that's consistently engaging.",B
6485,Fixed Bayonets!,"If the film has endured it's because of a few aspects particular to Fuller's career, which began not in film but in yellow journalism and pulp writing.",3.5/4
6486,Flags of Our Fathers,Effective as epic reconstruction of Iwo Jima's brutal combat and as timely deconstruction of the flag raising iconic image and the myth of war heroes as fabricated and sold by the power elite.,B+

6506,Fletch,A sparkling light comic mystery of the kind that Hollywood doesn't make anymore -- pity.,3.5/5
6507,Fletch Lives,Fletch Lives is one more dispirited slog through the rummage sale of movie cliches.,1.5/4
6508,Flex Is Kings,"Putting aside the generic human interest, however, Flex Is Kings turns out to be shockingly deficient in its on-screen depiction of flexing.",1.5/4
6509,Flicka,"Their voice is strong, they're just not singing a new tune.",2.5/5
6510,Flickering Lights,"A bleak male-bonding comedy that's a queasy blend of brutal humor and escalating sentimentality, it is overlong, heavy-handed, slow and unpersuasive.",1/5

6513,Flight of the Phoenix,Flight of the Phoenix is not only reductive but irrelevant too.,2/4
6514,Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge (The Flight of the Red Balloon),"Paying tribute to the 1956 French classic, and containing lyrical moments and graceful stylistic touches of its own, Hou's first French-language feature is better than his first foreign foray, the Tokyo-set Cafe Lumiere.",B+
6515,Flightplan,"Marred by implausibility, underdeveloped characters, and bad climax, technically Flightplan is great, taking full advantage of its confined space and restricted narrative time",B

6520,Flock of Dudes,"Flock Of Dudes is light on both bro-bonding shenanigans and worldly drama, despite boasting such an enviable cast of comedians.",5/10
6521,Floored,The film isn't pretty -- even the talking-head footage looks a bit hurried -- but neither is the milieu or the era it documents.,3/5
6522,Florence Foster Jenkins,There are no wrong notes in this film: Frears remains entirely confident within the emotional range he has chosen.,3/5
6523,Reaching for the Moon,Bruno Barreto's insistence that this pass for a product that Hollywood might have spawned smoothens a journey built on sharp edges.,1.5/4

6528,Flowers in the Attic,A muddled and unpleasant adaptation of a book that lots of women really like.,1/5
6529,Flowers in the Attic,This tale of a twisted family's misguided quest for love and money is still creepy and atmospheric enough to make for pulpy television fun.,2.5/4
6530,Floyd Norman: An Animated Life,"A fine introduction to the life and work of Floyd Norman, but it merely scratches the surface.",6.5/10
6531,Flu (Gamgi),"Buried beneath a melodramatic plot rife with unlikely coincidences and a love affair with fewer sparks than Robert De Niro's 1990 wooing of Jane Fonda in ""Stanley & Iris.""",2/5
6532,Flubber,How absent-minded do you have to be before they call in the doctors to begin clinical testing?,1/4
6533,Fluke,"As if banal platitudes about work-vs. -family aren't insufferable enough, there's a kicker gag involving Jackson that'll even have Mister Rogers begging for Pulp Fiction II.",1/4

6554,Food of Love,"The film sounds like the stuff of lurid melodrama, but what makes it interesting as a character study is the fact that the story is told from Paul's perspective.",2.5/5

6604,Forgetting The Girl,"A well observed, well acted character study about damaged souls whose orbits begin to exert a further destabilizing gravitational pull on one another. There's a smooth confidence at work here that never tips over into flamboyant stylistic overreach.",B+
6605,Forgiving Dr. Mengele,"What a surprisingly inspirational documentary this turns out to be -- and yet, it's not afraid to be straight to the point.",3/4
6606,The Forgotten,"Frightening and enthralling, and quite often, but the film's consummate thematic missteps cripple the project beyond repair.",2/4
6607,Forks Over Knives,Not as entertaining as the docs of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock but a must-see if we want to be healthy.,B+
6608,Formosa Betrayed,"While it is captivating stylistically, and the primer on the China/Taiwan relationship is great fodder for political geeks, even in its deepest moments of intrigue and pathos this is a cable TV movie at best.",3.5/5
6609,The Formula,The murder scene is littered with so many red herrings it might as well be a delicatessen.,2/5
6610,Forrest Gump,Reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney's America.,C
6611,The Forsaken,Reeks like the day old apple you left lying in you back seat after a long hot miserable driving day.,4/10
6612,Forsaken,A genuinely great performance from the younger Sutherland and fine supporting work from Demi Moore and Michael Wincott are ill-served by a director with little feel for the genre.,2/5
6613,Fort Apache,"This one is a reworking of the Custer myth, in a film that over sentimentalizes Army life and chivalry.",B
6614,Fort Bliss,A fairly conventional warrior-home-from-war drama lifted by a totally credible career-making performance by Michelle Monaghan.,3/4
6615,Fort McCoy,"Writer and co-director Kate Connor's debut feature ""Fort McCoy"" is an example of what happens when you try to shoehorn as many topics and themes from WWII as you can into one movie.",D
6616,Fort Tilden,"There are some similarities to the perpetual failings of the characters in Frances Ha, and this movie equally fails to charm.",1/5
6617,Fortress 2: Re-Entry,The only thing that Fortress 2: Re-entry does succeed at is in being an awful movie.,40/100
6618,The Fortune,Fascinating mess. Far better than its reputation suggests.,3/5
6619,Found,"Found. is a collision of desensitized youths, pure evil, brotherly bonds and one twisted killer's tale that's as consciously validated as it is horrifyingly destructive.",3/5
6620,Found Footage 3D,"'Found Footage 3D' is an absolute riot that's also quite scary, setting up a multitude of payoffs that deliver a flurry of satisfying punches.",4/5
6621,The Fountainhead,Seldom has symbolism been so leaden.,0/5
6622,Four,A cautionary tale featuring spectacular Fourth of July fireworks of the emotional variety.,3/4
6623,Four Brothers,"Due to clumsy helming, the combo of gritty urban drama and emotional family saga is strained, and the transitions from violent sequences to siblings bonding acts are jarring",C
6624,Four Christmases,It's not boring enough to be irritating and not funny enough to be entertaining. It's just not worth the trouble.,2/5
6625,The Four Feathers,The vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful.,3/5
6626,Four for Texas,A stupid and overlong Rat Pack sex comedy Western that bites the dust with hardly any intentional laughs.,C
6627,Four Hands (Die Vierhändige),"Although the plot can sometimes veer into the preposterous and the script's twists and turns aren't nearly as unpredictable as Kienle would like to believe, Four Hands works as an entertaining exercise in genre filmmaking.",8/10
6628,Four Horsemen,"This is a film perhaps better suited to DVD, simply because there are thoughts here of such profundity you might feel the need to reach for the rewind button. I, for one, have been left substantially enlightened.",4/5
6629,Four Kids and It,A children's film that manages to be feelgood but never too cutesy.,3/5
6630,Four Lions,Both laugh-out-loud funny and as serious as a bullet through your artery.,4/5
6631,Four Minutes,"Through the despair and stormy interactions of the two main characters, we scrape beneath their crusty exterior surfaces and get a glimpse at the hurt and hopefulness within.",B+
6632,The Four Musketeers,"More a continuation than a sequel (this and it's predecesor were filmed at the same time, prompting some changes in SAG rules), this is still one of the best adaptations yest of the Dumas stories.",4/5
6633,Four Rooms,A slapdash stew of mostly unfunny gags.,2/4
6634,Four Weddings and a Funeral,It's bright and spirited and well-paced.,7/10
6635,The Fourth Kind,There's nothing in this glorified Power Point presentation that stands up to even the most cursory scrutiny.,1.5/5
6636,Fox and His Friends,Fox's journey downward is more of a straight shot than a spiral.,3/5
6637,The Fox and the Hound,Too long given the dearth of ideas in the script.,2/4
6638,The Fox and the Hound 2,"Like most sequels, it's a pale imitation of the original.",4/10
6639,Foxcatcher,A thought-provoking and solid piece of work.,8.8/10
6640,Foxy Brown,"Fearless, explosive action. Grier is astonishing.",4/5
6641,FrackNation,Its strongest and most interesting case against Gasland is not so much with refute of its claims as with address of its impact and what this says about modern journalism.,B-
6642,Fracture,"Hoblit's elegantly shot psychological thriller for adults is sharply uneven: It has a wonderful beginning, a long, diffuse, and uninvolving center, and a satisfying ending. But despite the flaws, the actors, particularly Ryan Gosling, are superb.",B
6643,Fractured,Brad Anderson really hates hospitals.,6.5/10
6644,Fragments,"It's a worthy effort, and Woods pieces the parts together with skill and sensitivity. But, perhaps weighed down too heavily by its subject matter, Winged Creatures never takes flight.",3/5
6645,Frailty,"As a director, Paxton is surprisingly brilliant, deftly sewing together what could have been a confusing and horrifying vision into an intense and engrossing head-trip.",4.5/5
6646,Framing John DeLorean,"It's enjoyable enough, though a little on the long side...",3/5
6647,Frances,"Despite the cardboard characters she's surrounded by, Jessica Lange single-handedly makes this depressing film worth watching.",70/100
6648,Frances Ha,"One of the sweetest and funniest films of the year. Frances Ha is a wonderful story about growing up, staying young, about love, life, friendship and what happens to it all over time.",4/5
6649,Francis,These goofy comedies made more money than anyone expected and director Lubin went on to create another successful talking equine for television in Mr. Ed.,3/4
6650,Francofonia,"Francofonia is a Russian documentary that weaves between archival footage and pictures and historical re-creation to tell the story of the Louvre, primarily during the German occupation of France during WWII.",B+
6651,Frank,"Off-beat and punk-spirited, Sievey would no doubt approve of the tone and style of this movie.",4/5
6652,Frank & Jesse,Darn solid cable-flick western with a tight pace and an excellent cast.,4/5
6653,Frank & Lola,"For a directorial debut, Ross's film is admirably odd and hard to pin down. What first starts as a meet-cute love story slowly morphs into a globe-trotting thriller, only to settle down into something altogether more bizarre and disturbing.",4/5
6654,Frank and Ollie,Charming.,3/5
6655,Frank Miller's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For,"Nine years after the pages first turned on Sin City, and with three major parts recast, this Dame To Kill For is sashaying into town long after everyone has lost interest.",2/5
6656,Frank Serpico,A must for fans of upstanding citizenry.,3/5
6657,Frankenhooker,"It thinks it's funnier than it is, but it's still pretty funny",3/5
6658,Frankenstein,No neck bolts or flat-top 'do here. This Frankenstein is a thoroughly modern monster who doesn't fit into our class-based society.,2.5/4
6659,Frankenstein and the Monster from Hell,"Last gasp in the Hammer Frankensteins. Not as dull as some, but with a ridiculous monster",2/5
6660,Frankenstein Created Woman,Great cure for insomnia.,2/5
6661,Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man,Doesn't deliver all that much of what the title promises.,2/5
6662,Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed,One of the finest of the seven entries in Hammer's Frankenstein cycle.,3.5/4
6663,Frankenstein's Army,"Like the monster evoked by the film's title, everything feels tacked together.",1.5/5
6664,"Frankenstein's Monster's Monster, Frankenstein",The main benefit of its brevity is that you can fit in multiple viewings without breaking a sweat-something wholeheartedly recommended.,3.5/5
6665,Frankenweenie,"I don't think Burton has ever connected with his audience like this... ['Frankenweenie'] is overflowing with passion, creativity and genuine heart.",4.5/5
6666,Frankie & Alice,"A hokey old-school drama of multiple personality disorder based, in the tradition of The Three Faces of Eve and Sybil, on a real case study.",C+
6667,Frankie and Johnny Are Married,"light and playful, but it's also a hint of this couple's embrace of art and marriage.",3.5/5
6668,Frantz,"As enticing as it is to get lost in its dazzling sleight of hand, there's too little to be found at the end to enlighten or even satisfy.",B-
6669,Freak Show,"At the heart of this tale, and the film's paramount appeal, is the staggeringly impressive turn by Lawther, who manages to be so overtly confident in the role, and yet internally so vulnerable.",3/5
6670,Freakdog (Red Mist),"Paddy Breathnach's second horror outing plays much like his first, mixing genres and influences into a heady cocktail - although this time around the flavours may no longer satisfy the jaded palate.",3/5
6671,Freakonomics,"Swift and easily digestible. None of it will likely provoke discussion, though ... doesn't seem to be anything more substantial than interesting yet trivial data.",2.5/5
6672,Freaks,Browning's film really works to get the audience to view things from the freaks' perspective,A
6673,Freaks,All the elements of Freaks worked against each other. The movie fell absolutely flat.,1/5
6674,Freaky Friday,"There's enough intelligence and wit here to sustain your interest, especially when Curtis and Lohan are in peak form.",3/5
6675,Fred Armisen: Standup For Drummers,"Armisen is deft with impressions and characters, but as a standup he still needs practice.",2.5/5
6676,Fred: The Movie,If there's a more irritating film this year I'd hate to see it so close to this Nickelodeon TV movie.,1/5
6677,Fred Won't Move Out,"Except for a subplot about a missing cat that suggests that Fred may be considerably dottier than he appears, the movie gets almost everything right about the uncomfortable moment when grown children are forced to be their parents' parents.",3/5
6678,Freddy Got Fingered,Hated it so much so very very much,0/4
6679,Freddy vs. Jason,A lively concoction of genre in-jokes with elements that'll please fans of both murderous characters.,3/5
6680,Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"Hardly a fitting capstone to one of the genre's more original notions, but after six tries, what should we expect? Something better than this tripe, surely.",0/5
6681,Free Angela & All Political Prisoners,"After watching 'Free Angela and All Political Prisoners,' audiences will walk away rejuvenated, thankful and, surprisingly, even more proud to be an American.",A
6682,Free Birds,"Frozen, undercooked and sorely lacking much in the way of ""all the trimmings,"" this turkey isn't ready to serve.",1.5/4
6683,Free China: The Courage to Believe,"Though his treatment of the subject is often superficial, Perlman makes a clear argument for the broader implications, especially for Western consumers.",3/5
6684,Free Enterprise,"The fun of Free Enterprise, which occasionally runs a bit thin but is mostly sustained by the filmmakers' verve and wit, lies in its many visual and verbal references to popular culture trivia.",3/5
6685,Free Fire,I ran out of patience long before the participants ran out of ammo.,4/10
6686,Free Men,For a change a film that casts Islam in a positive light.,B
6687,Free Money,Too many cooks in the kitchen?,1/5
6688,Free Radicals,"Barbara Albert's contemptuous Free Radicals unravels like an Austrian Short Cuts, except there's no humanity buried beneath the life-is-bleak passages of the film.",1/4
6689,Free Ride,"In between bizarrely low-octane moments of authorities circling the ring, the soulful up-and-comer crafts a far more perilous tale, one of a teenage caretaker getting a crash course in growing up too fast, too soon.",2/5
6690,Free Samples,"A deeply unpleasant micro-budget indie that has no clue how to extrapolate a single location into an entire feature, Free Samples is an ugly bit of work.",1/5
6691,Free Solo,"""Free Solo"" is so absorbing because it strives for even a tenuous grip on the balance between love and need.",B+
6692,Free State of Jones,"Flowing like a miniseries that's been cleaved down to 145 minutes, and shot with the boxed-in functionality of basic cable television, it would be a misfire even if it weren't completely tone-deaf to the current climate.",C-
6693,Free The Mind,"An enlightening documentary about using mindfulness, breathing techniques, and yoga to reprogram the brain and ease the mind.",4/5
6694,Free the Nipple,This is kind of didactic topical movie that distributes its rhetoric evenly between characters with clear distinction as to who's playing devil's advocate to the other one's points.,1/4
6695,Free to Run,The doc's caginess is a weakness that results from an inherently nostalgic sense of reverie.,2/4
6696,Free Willy,Don't be put off by the dumb title. Free Willy has its heart in the right place.,2.5/4
6697,Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home,"The first movie appealed to me because I bought into the characters and the situation. Because ""Free Willy 2"" offers essentially the same characters and the same situation, only less believable, I became aware of the manipulation.",2.5/4
6698,Free Willy 3: The Rescue,There is a majesty to whales that the second Willy movie trivialized. Part three returns to some of the human elements that made the first movie so good.,3/4
6699,Freebie and the Bean,"It has a cast of otherwise good actors doing bits of business (sometimes called acting) as if they thought they could upstage all of the movie's automobiles, which are seldom still.",1.5/5
6700,Freedom,"Performances are fine, and the film is well made, but it's too much of a hybrid to be successful.",2/5
6701,Freedom Writers,"For those who see it, the movie has a chance to connect. Freedom Writers is superior to what film-goers typically expect from an early January release.",3/4
6702,Freedomland,It takes an especially inept director to get such a hysterical and unsympathetic performance from Julianne Moore and such a rambling and messy picture out of Richard Price's timely and explosive novel.,C
6703,Freeheld,An impressive cast and significant real-life events can't trump the fact it's a badly made movie.,C
6704,Freejack,"...a trite screenplay, limp pacing, and lackluster acting.",5/10
6705,Freestyle,Ebullient hip-hop documentary.,3/5
6706,Freetown,"A dawdling, flat account of African missionaries on the run from rebels that takes forever to get going and even longer to arrive.",1.5/4
6707,Freeway 2: Confessions of a Trickbaby (Freeway II: Confessions of a Trickbaby),"It works on its own snarly, baroque terms.",5/5
6708,Freeze Frame,"Uma premissa original e inteligente que é muito bem explorada pelo estreante diretor John Simpson e pelo comediante Lee Evans, surpreendentemente eficaz em um papel dramático.",5/5
6709,Freezer,No one involved with the making of this movie should be allowed to work again.,3/10
6710,The French Connection,"This film demonstrates how smart action movies can be, and points out how dumbed down most of them have gotten.",9/10
6711,The French Connection II,"Couldn't even hold the original film's hat, but earns points just for not sucking outright.",3/5
6712,The French Lieutenant's Woman,Characters don't talk to each other -- they talk to the camera,3/5
6713,French Twist (Gazon maudit),"Set aside the subject matter, and French Twist is as simple, as moronic and as uninteresting as the American ""dumb and dumber"" movies.",1.5/4
6714,Frenzy,"Even though this is a quality film, for the first time, I came away from a Hitchcock movie with a bad taste in my mouth.",72/100
6715,Frequency,"A highly professional thriller with an ingenious plot, but what really stands out are the character-based moments. They moved me to the brink of tears.",9/10
6716,Fresh,"Here's a movie filled with drama and excitement, unfolding a plot of brilliant complexity, in which the central character is solemn and silent, saying only what he has to say, revealing himself only strategically.",4/4
6717,Fresh,"Ultimately a necessary genealogy of the ""we are what we eat"" cliche, a welcome reminder of how eating is the inadvertent daily exercise of politics.",2.5/4
6718,Fresh Dressed,"Journalist-director Sacha Jenkins is careful not to tread too heavily on Adidas-clad nostalgia, instead unearthing valuable NYC history by talking to forgotten tailors and outfitters like Harlem's legendary Dapper Dan, who made miracles out of nothing.",4/5
6719,Freshman Orientation,I was honored and privileged to say that I saw a film at Sundance that actually captured the fun of pretending to be gay to win a sorority sister.,3/4
6720,Frida,Star/producer Salma Hayek and director Julie Taymor have infused Frida with a visual style unique and inherent to the titular character's paintings and in the process created a masterful work of art of their own.,3.5/5
6721,Friday,"Friday stars several actors who can't act. It also stars a rapper who can't rap. His name is ""Ice Cube"" and, after seeing this movie (among others) he can officially name himself the king of movies that lack acting talent, as far as I'm concerned.",0/4
6722,Friday the 13th - The Final Chapter,The last 15 minutes or so is a very satisfying bit of horror cinema.,3/5
6723,Friday After Next,... the best in a truly awful series.,1.5/4
6724,Friday Night Lights,"[The characters are] much more flawed that the usual cookie cutter characters found in sports flicks, and it's difficult not to become emotionally involved in their plight.",7/10
6725,Friday the 13th,The slasher king.,9/10
6726,Friday the 13th Part 2,"Friday The 13th Part 2 doesn't take place on Friday the 13th, but that's about the only liberty this generic horror film takes with convention.",57/100
6727,Friday the 13th Part 3,The film was shot in 3D and looks pretty bland on video or DVD.,27/100
6728,"Friday the 13th, Part V - A New Beginning",Jason's faux-comeback is a dreary and uninvolving affair.,29/100
6729,"Friday the 13th, Part VI - Jason Lives",A sly sense of humor helps alleviate the tedium of the 6th go-round.,59/100
6730,Friday the 13th Part VII - The New Blood,"When a hardcore Friday the 13th fan tells you that a particular entry is a piece of junk, you should probably listen.",39/100
6731,Friday the 13th Part VIII - Jason Takes Manhattan,"As shrink-wrapped slaying goes there is no equal and, until moviegoers demand otherwise, the uninspired trail of blood and body parts will continue.",1.5/4
6732,Friday the 13th,A classic is a classic and attempts to remake are usually ridiculed. This is no exception.,2/5
6733,Fried Green Tomatoes,"Fried Green Tomatoes is a thoroughly enjoyable movie-going experience, replete with laughter, tears, triumph, and tragedy.",3.5/4
6734,Friend Request,The serious issues the film is exploring get pushed to the wayside in favour of shoehorning in gimmicky frights.,2/5
6735,Friendly Persuasion,"A big, colorful, entertaining movie that could only have been made in the 1950s.",3.5/5
6736,Friends With Benefits,Mila Kunis is one of the most endearing comedic talents to grace the silver screen in years.,8/10
6737,Friends With Kids,"[Westfeldt a] better filmmaker than she is a movie star; the sharply observed comedy...would have been better served with Westfeldt in a supporting role, with the underutilized Kristen Wiig in the lead.",B
6738,Friends With Money,Holofcener has an uncommonly keen eye for the nuances of awkward public discourse between people of varied social status.,B-
6739,Fright Night,"Slick popcorn horror, faithful to the fun and flair of the original.",3/5
6740,Fritz the Cat,"Full of animated, nude, cartoon animals and some of the most vitriolic racism (disguised as empowerment) ever put on film, Fritz the Cat is so bad that Crumb, after seeing the film, killed the character in one of his comics.",1.5/5
6741,Frogs,"Hmm, I wonder why it's called FROGS...",40/100
6742,Frogs for Snakes,"Not a film so much as a filmed idea. That could be interesting, but alas it is a very bad idea.",0/4
6743,From Other Worlds,"This is all very lightweight and low-budget stuff, but this pleasant comedy sort of grows on the viewer. There is nothing earth-shaking here, but the film is likeable in a gentle way.",6/10
6744,From Time to Time,Casts a magical spell by the touching conclusion.,3/5
6745,From Beijing with Love,James Bond spoof that is much more bloody than amusing.,1/5
6746,From Beyond,"From Beyond doesn't quite measure up [to Re-Animator] -- it's not trashy enough and it doesn't have the insane tunnel vision of the first movie -- but in its own way, this is quite a job.",2.5/4
6747,From Beyond the Grave,"As tales from graves and crypts go, these go quite far enough.",2/4
6748,From Dusk Till Dawn,From Dusk Till Dawn was probably spawned from an all night bender during which Tarantino and Rodriguez thought it would be fun to see if they could make a deliberately lame movie with someone else's money.,2/4
6749,From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money,Forgettable made-for-video horror stuff.,2/5
6750,From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter,Melhor que o segundo filme - o que no quer dizer muita coisa.,2/5
6751,From Hell,The film's London becomes a deliriously bloody embodiment of inferno itself.,3/4
6752,From Justin To Kelly,"Some people wait a lifetime for a turkey like this -- and for them,'From Justin to Kelly' will provide a holiday feast. ...a spectacularly wretched musical melodrama.",0/5
6753,From Noon Till Three,One of the most unappealing offbeat romantic/comedy Westerns ever.,C-
6754,From Nowhere,"Even at its most mechanistic ... From Nowhere largely avoids preachiness and sanctimony, preferring to wrestle with the real world in all its stubborn complexity.",B+
6755,From Paris with Love,You've never seen Travolta like this. Do not consider that to be a compliment.,C
6756,From Prada to Nada,"A rueful, occasionally touching and entirely predictable romantic comedy with a terrible title.",2.5/5
6757,From Russia With Love,...more outright suspense and excitement than any of the newer concoctions.,8/10
6758,From The Head,"Griffith's wry dramedy is both a character study and a personal showcase, but his fatal flaw is that Shoes just isn't as interesting as the drunks, jerks, goons and dreamers who stumble into his lair to relieve themselves.",2.5/5
6759,From the Hip,"I don't know much about the law, but I know enough to assure you that ""From the Hip"" is completely implausible from beginning to end.",2.5/4
6760,From the Land of the Moon (Mal de pierres),"The film takes on Gabrielle's listlessness, slumps into an opiated fug. The malady is mysterious and not easily treatable. It just exhausts you.",2/5
6761,Aus dem Leben der Marionetten (From the Life of the Marionettes),"The title signifies that the husband is just another puppet in the scheme of things, unable to properly respond to sensual and emotional arousal that varies from the routine structure.",2.5/4
6762,From the Terrace,"An epic winker that uses, in its best moment, a rocking dinghy as a euphemism.",1/4
6763,From Up On Poppy Hill,"Miyazaki, yes, but Goro and not Hayao",2.5/4
6764,The Front,"Offers the bonus of the reality of its makers' involvement, and one of the greatest closing lines in the history of film.",4/5
6765,Front Cover,The very few instances where stereotypes are challenged are forced and didactically delivered.,0.5/4
6766,Frontera,"...when Berry, making his feature writing and directing debut, takes the time to do something unexpected, it usually pays off.",3/5
6767,Frontier(s),A patently over-the-top piece of gore-drenched survival horror. Very familiar but very fun.,4/5
6768,Frontrunners,"[a]neatly made but, ultimately, tepid high-school election documentary",2.5/5
6769,Frost (The Last International Playboy),Anyone who is even vaguely aware of New York's literary high society -- even from a casual thumbing of the New York Times' Sunday Styles section -- will realize this film is all posing and no pulse.,1.5/5
6770,Frost/Nixon,One of the most gripping and entertaining political dramas in recent memory.,4/5
6771,Frozen,"Frozen is an exhilarating, joyous, human story that's as frequently laugh-out-loud funny as it is startling and daring and poignant.",5/5
6772,Frozen II,"Great new tunes, a hilarious Olaf, and already beloved characters are powerful enough to elevate an otherwise clunky and frankly uninteresting story",B
6773,Frozen River,"A highlight of Sundance fest, Hunt's feature debut centers on the famale camarederie between two vastly disparate poor women, a white and a Native American, both single moms, whose paths crisscross under the most bizarre and risky cicrumstances.",A-
6774,Fruitvale Station,"If you leave the film with dry eyes, you're a hell of a lot stronger than me, or than anyone in the Eccles theater the night I saw the film.",9.2/10
6775,Fubar: Balls to the Wall,"Though the energy flags a little in the film's second half, overall the comedy feels nervy and original.",3/4
6776,The Fugitive Kind,An almost unbelievably sluggish and uninflected adaptation of Tennessee Williams' searing Orpheus Descending.,D
6777,Fugitive Pieces,"Though pretentious and structurally problematic, Podeswa's tale of a Holocaust survivor is ambitious and occasionally lyrical and powerful, adding another honorable panel to the growing body of works on the catastrophic phenomenon.",B-
6778,Full Tilt Boogie,"Full-Tilt Boogie is a tribute to the people who work behind the camera, but don't normally compete for golden statues on Oscar night.",76/100
6779,Full Battle Rattle,There's an irony in the contrast of Iraqi-Americans talking about life in this country and watching the military-industrial complex putting the finishing touches on young emlistees about to ship out to a godforsaken land to kill or be killed.,4/4
6780,Full Contact,"With Full Contact, Lam takes the action genre and proceeds to not merely transcend it but explode it.",10/10
6781,Full Frontal,A sometimes realistically and other times unrealistically portrayed group of mostly unlikeable men and women undergoing an identity or 'middle-age' crisis.,4/10
6782,Full Metal Jacket,[Kubrick's] third best.,6/8
6783,The Full Monty,It's a familiar show-biz routine but one that's spangled with happy surprises and sharp acting.,3.5/4

6789,Fun Mom Dinner,Fun Mom Dinner is the equivalent of mom using bargain basement ingredients to make your favorite homecooked meal.,2/5
6790,Fun Size,"There remains a huge market for a great Halloween teen comedy, but Fun Size is the disappointing apple that your crazy-haired neighbor gives you instead of candy. Feel free to dump this one in the bushes.",D+
6791,Fun With Dick and Jane,Social commentary mingles with stupid comedy in this humorless update of a 1977 George Segal-Jane Fonda romp.,1.5/4

6793,Funeral Kings,"One of the funniest movies about selfish, vulgar, horny 14-year-olds in quite some time.",4/5

6795,Funny Bones,Funny Bones is entertaining and absorbing for what it is. But what it isn't could have really been something.,3/4

6890,Geostorm,The climate change angle is mere window dressing for what is essentially another 'Gerard Butler action film'.,2.5/5
6891,Gerald's Game,"This is an excellent adaptation of one of Stephen King's more underrated works, by a savvy director who respects the material but makes the film his own.",8/10
6892,Gerhard Richter Painting,"In the first documentary he's agreed to in fifteen years, Corinna Belz eschews voiceover narration in favour of a low-key, fly-on-the-wall look at the man in his studio painting.",3/5
6893,Germinal,"For me, Germinal provided visual and dramatic images for 19th century history events that I only understood in an abstract way.",3/4

6899,Get a Job,A comedy that's neither clever enough nor sufficiently over the top.,C
6900,Get Bruce,"[It's] the kind of documentary we all want to have made about ourselves, in which it is revealed that we are funny, smart, beloved, the trusted confidant of famous people, the power behind the scenes at great events and the apple of our mother's eye.",3/4
6901,Get Gone,"A laughably inept horror movie with a plot ripped right out of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes and their dozens of imitators, delivered without any suspense.",D+
6902,Get Hard,Get Hard quickly descends from an off-putting comedy of opposites to the kind of movie that time and the changing styles of comedy in the modern age will turn into a relic sooner rather than later.,D+
6903,Get In,"Skittishly jumping between family drama and psychological thriller, this French production is a mishmash of half-baked ideas that thinks it's got far more to say than it actually does.",1/5
6904,Get Low,...an affable piece of work whose individual elements are often more engrossing than the whole...,2.5/4
6905,Get Married If You Can,"Doesn't offer anything we haven't seen in the genre already, but it's a nice and entertaining story. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
6906,Get Me Roger Stone,"Get Me Roger Stone never asks you to root for its eponymous agent of chaos, but he's a more compulsively watchable villain than any Marvel or DC movie has ever had.",B+

6913,Get Santa,"Get Santa is a tonally tin-eared Christmas experiment, but at least it's a unique one.",4/10
6914,Get Shorty,"While it's quite possible for the cinematically unaware to enjoy this film, this is a real treat for movie buffs. The story is as much about the love of motion pictures as it is about gangsters.",3.5/4

6959,G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra,"If I was 10 years old, GI Joe would be one of the best movies I had ever seen. As a grown up it's one of the better summer movies; a delightfully light, fun and action-packed kick in the ass.",8.5/10

6986,Girl In Progress,"A deconstructionist take on the teenaged coming-of-age story, director Patricia Riggen's fair adaptation of Hiram Martinez's screenplay makes bold commentary on immigrant culture and values in America.",B-
6987,"Girl, Interrupted",'Some advice ... never stick your finger out at a crazy person',2.5/4
6988,Girl Model,"The filmmakers stay back, observing, for a restrained, intimate and poignant result.",4/5
6989,Girl Most Likely,"Hollow, uninteresting and false.",D+
6990,Girl On A Bicycle,Pretty actors and pretty Paris locations don't rescue this limp collection of weary Euro-nationalist stereotypes and the lame situations the story puts them in,2/4
6991,Girl on the Third Floor,A truly memorable directorial debut.,4/5
6992,Girl Rising,Powerful docu explains why all girls need an education.,4/5
6993,The Girl Who Played with Fire (Flickan som lekte med elden),Not as intense as the first episode but filled with sharp characterizations.,B
6994,Girl With a Pearl Earring,"As muted and still as a Vermeer painting, Girl With a Pearl Earring has atmosphere to burn and a near-total action vacuum.",2.5/5
6995,Girl with Green Eyes,The film that made Rita Tushingham a star.,B
6996,Red Riding Hood,Here's hoping Hardwicke can top this masterpiece with her inevitable adaptation of Jack Jumps Over the Candlestick.,1.5/4
6997,Girlfight,An okay film weighed down in cliches but more than made up for by its very real characters and the charismatic performance turned in by its star.,6/10
6998,Girlfriend,"Girlfriend is surprisingly backward not only in the story that entangles its main character, but also in its characterization of women.",1.5/4
6999,The Girlfriend Experience,"with its fragmented narrative and cinéma vérité approach, recalls Jean-Luc Godard's exploration of the life of a prostitute, Vivre sa vie",4/5
7000,Girlfriend's Day,"By the time it's all over, you're left with the same giddiness you feel after reading a Daniel Clowes comic or a Jonathan Ames story",8/10
7001,Girlhood,A compelling and ultimately positive portrait of teenagers.,4/4
7002,Girlhood,"Girlhood is a fascinatingly layered, textured film that manages to be both a lament for sweetness lost and a celebration of wisdom and identity gained, often at the very same moment.",A-
7003,Girls Against Boys,Essentially a horror movie in which the source of the horror shifts from capital-M men to crazed lesbianism.,1/4
7004,Girls Can't Swim,"Yes they can swim, the title is merely Anne-Sophie Birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through.",2/4
7005,Girls Just Want to Have Fun,"If you're going to base a movie on a song, why not choose a song that's, y'know, about something?",2/5
7006,Girls of the Sun (Les filles du soleil),"Girls of the Sun is partisan and it wears its heart on its sleeve: a powerful, forceful story.",4/5
7007,Girls Trip,"Where Rough Night apparently failed, Girls Trip succeeds, perfectly capturing what it feels like when women who genuinely love each other let their hair down together and just have a good time",4.5/5
7008,Girls Will Be Girls,"Plays out like a shticky, vulgar sitcom in which the featured characters are bitchy stereotypes.",D+
7009,Girls with Balls,"Girls With Balls doesn't atone for the leery ""females vs. males"" horror normalization of exploitations past, but it is a slaughter-tastic midnight movie about volleyball vixens defending themselves from backwoods killers.",6.5/10
7010,Girly,"This forgotten oddity is ripe for rediscovery -- like its characters, it may get to you even if you don't realize it.",3.5/5
7011,Giuliani Time,"Keating wants to bust apart the myth of Giuliani's sanctification after 9/11, but with the film set to open only in New York, what he's really doing is preaching to the choir.",2.5/4
7012,Give Me Liberty,"It's thrilling to watch a filmmaker work overtime to explore what it means to get lost in the moment, lose track of the bigger picture, and then discover it all over again.",B
7013,Donne-moi la main (Give Me Your Hand),Represents the most attractively shot twin porn off all time.,2/4
7014,Give Up Tomorrow,"A tale so outrageous, unjust and unbelievable that it could only be true.",4/5
7015,Gladiator,A joyous return of the cinematic epic.,10/10
7016,Glass,"The Sixth Sense, still his only great film, is also a therapy psychodrama, but whereas that ghost story reckoned with bedrock matters of loss and child abuse, Glass assumes that we're all going to lean in at dialogue about comic books.",2/5
7017,Glass: A Portrait of Philip in Twelve Parts,Glass acts as a tuning fork that calibrates the significance of a compelling 20th century composer who is still going strong into the 21st.,3/5
7018,Glass Chin,"The story is familiar, but the director undermines the tight, expected narrative turns of such a film by focusing on the cast's worn-in and jazzy repartee and expressing a perfectly modulated sense of self-awareness.",3/4
7019,The Glass House,"There are some glaring second-act continuity problems and by the time we got to the inevitable bloodletting climax, a Seattle preview audience was roaring at the film's glaring predictability.",C+
7020,Glassland,An absorbing drama that deals with severe themes in an intriguing manner.,4/5
7021,Gleason,The director of Finders Keepers proves again that he's brilliant at balancing the devastating and the hilarious.,4/5
7022,Glee: The 3D Concert Movie,"Gleeks unite for song, dance and screams",3/5

7024,Glen or Glenda?,"In every technical aspect, it's just bad. However, only Ed Wood could pull off being so bad that it's good -- good in a funny, screwed up way.",3/5
7025,Glengarry Glen Ross,"The performers achieve a true ensemble rhythm; at times, the entire office seems like a single, shouting organism.",A

7029,Gloria,"... the upbeat, feel-good finale goes a long way towards ensuring that Gloria concludes on a high note...",2.5/4
7030,Gloria,"Gloria is an important film because its based on real facts, but it would've been better if it wasn't. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
7031,Gloria Bell,"Gloria Bell pairs perhaps the best portrayer of troubled or lost women with a director who has built a career building stories around them, and the result is a film that comfortably banishes any fears of some neutered US remake.",4/5
7032,Glorious 39,"Stupendous turn from Romola Garai in the lead role but, while this sets up intrigue and atmosphere well, the plot devices creak audibly towards the end.",3/5
7033,GMO OMG,Why anyone would think that home movies of the director and his kids belong in a social-issues doc is a truly WTF question.,2/5
7034,Gnomeo and Juliet,A surprisingly entertaining animated caper...,3/5
7035,Go Back to China,Good performances and a simple story about an overly complicated family dynamic all comes together making a wonderful story of family.,8/10
7036,Go For Sisters,"Go for Sisters is a showcase for the best and worst of Sayles' work taking a melodramatic plot and adding layers of character into it, using genre as platform to explore different cultures and the way they bounce off one another.",7/10
7037,Go Further,...a crowd pleaser in its purest form...,3/4
7038,Go Karts (Go!),...crowd-pleasing entertainment.,16/20
7039,Go Tigers!,"A doc that's more spirited than most action-adventure pics--about a top-rated, small-town high-school football team.",3/4
7040,Goal II: Living the Dream,Filmically it's more of a pleasantly diverting kick about in the park than a 90th minute back-of-the-net at the world cup final.,3/5
7041,Goat,"At its core, ""Goat"" is really an old-fashioned exploitation film - one that clucks its tongue over a social problem while inviting its audience to enjoy the spectacle. The spectacle is actually pretty spectacular. The tongue-clucking not so much.",B-
7042,Goats,"""Goats"" is standing on the shoulders of its coming-of-age predecessors, adding nothing except a reminder that every generation goes through the same thing - evidently, cinematically as well as personally.",C+
7043,God Bless America,"If you have any complaints about current American culture, this is a comedy for you.",4/5
7044,God Bless Ozzy Osbourne,"Produced by Jack, Ozzy's son, the project has a poignancy that it doesn't have as a movie experience.",2.5/5
7045,God Bless the Broken Road,"Like nine out of 10 faith-based films, it lets the message crowd out the other elements of good art: character development, thematic complexity, even basics such as a compelling conflict.",2/5
7046,God Grew Tired Of Us,"It's a portrait of both suffering and success, and one that the directors refuse to gussy up in overly sentimental or derisive ways.",3/4
7047,God Help the Girl,"It's warm and generous, verging on the sentimental; a film that crystallises the best and worst of Belle and Sebastian's songwriting skills.",3/5
7048,God Knows Where I Am,"Though the film excels at subjectivity and interiority, it tends to falter in conveying more rudimentary information.",2.5/4
7049,God Loves Uganda,"...unable to peddle their nonsense in the U.S., the evangelicals have found a ready target in Uganda, an English-speaking and primarily Christian country with a long history of evangelical missionary work...",7/10
7050,God of War,God Of War's engaging storytelling is a pleasant surprise.,4/5
7051,God Said 'Ha!',"Were Julia Sweeney not such a gifted comedienne, listening to her uncompromising account of her brother Michael's struggle with lymphatic cancer would be unbearable.",3/4
7052,"God, Sex & Apple Pie",Well-written and surprisingly well-acted by a relatively inexperienced cast.,2.5/5
7053,God Told Me To,only those who are intensely religious will be offended; the rest of us can just smile at the film's simple and entertaining absurdity,2.5/4
7054,The Godfather,"One of the central American movies of the last 25 years, and one of very few to succed as both popular entertainment and high art.",5/5
7055,"The Godfather, Part II","A true classic, one of the pillars of modern cinema.",8/10
7056,"The Godfather, Part III","Though certainly one of 1990's better films, it is seriously flawed and doesn't hold a candle to the two earlier Godfather movies, considered in most critical corners to be among the best, if not the best, films of the 1970s.",3/4
7057,Gods and Generals,"A movie experience that lasts more than four hours. I wouldn't even want to make out with Jennifer Garner for more than, like, three hours.",3/10
7058,Gods and Monsters,"Whale, always the aesthete and snob, comments to an interviewer that the other Frankenstein films were done by hacks.",B+
7059,God's Horses,"Nabil Ayouch's film allows us see how young suicide bombers--""horses of God,"" as the man in charge of their mission calls them--might deserve our pity.",3/4
7060,The Gods Must Be Crazy II,"Uys's style sheds a sweet and gentle light on this new comedy, which is a sequel to the surprising international success -- and, I think, a better film.",3/4
7061,God's Not Dead,I do believe God's not dead. I just have a hard time swallowing that saying so is the act of profound spiritual courage that the film makes it out to be.,1/4
7062,God's Not Dead 2,"A commendable drama that, despite some flaws, raises serious questions about religious prosecution and political correctness.",3/4
7063,God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness,"A Light In Darkness isn't as offensive as the first film-it lacks the requisite misogyny and Islamophobia, and does a better job of looking like it's almost a real movie-but it's not far behind, an emblematic film for the foul moment.",F
7064,Gods Of Egypt,A fun movie that doesn't do anything ironically. But the gods deserved better. [Full review in Spanish],5/10
7065,Gods of the Plague (Gotter der Pest),"The narrative is random and disposable, which means you'll have to settle for the allure of the film's many women.",2.5/4
7066,God's Own Country,Heartbreaking.. shines a new spotlight on a familiar story.,B-
7067,God's Pocket,"Pretty dull, although the performances are excellent.",5/10
7068,Godsend,So full of ridiculous moments that it's hard to hold down the laughter.,1.5/4
7069,Godspeed,Suggests Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood but without the gallows humor or eye for regional detail.,2/4
7070,Godspell,Seventies musical based on the Gospel of St. Matthew is spirited and touching.,4/5
7071,Godzilla,Godzilla represents the final step of post-war Japan to saddle us with a byproduct of American nuclear waste.,2/5
7072,"Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack",Really silly and quite bad. But easily hilarious enough to sit through.,2/5
7073,Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.,"This modern series is one that's improving with each entry, and all of them are big ol' heaps of rubber suit glee.",3/5
7074,Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla II (Gojira VS Mekagojira),The script seamlessly combines the story of human beings with the more operatic story of the godlike beasts.,A-
7075,Godzilla vs. Megalon,"Silly, cheesy, ridiculous, and above all, fun.",3/5
7076,Godzilla (Gojira),Japan's classic monster movie in its original and better form.,4/5
7077,Godzilla 2000,"Low production values, high camp and a guy in a giant rubber reptile suit rampaging through a detailed miniature of Tokyo, knocking down buildings, kicking cars and breathing fire! Yeah, that's the stuff!",3/4
7078,Godzilla,"Manages to deliver all the big crowd-pleasing moments we want from our blockbuster devastation epics and leave us wanting more, in the best possible way.",8.5/10
7079,Godzilla and Mothra: The Battle for Earth (Gojira vs. Mosura),Maybe they both could lose? Don't wish for too much.,1/5
7080,"Godzilla, King of the Monsters!","The one that started it all. And by all I mean ""a series of progressively more atrocious sequels and one abysmal remake.""",4/5
7081,Godzilla: King of the Monsters,"On a visual level, nearly every single frame of Godzilla: King of the Monsters feels like a work of art, with many moments evoking the spirit of Frank Frazetta's artistic creations (especially during the scenes with King Ghidorah).",4/5
7082,Godzilla Resurgence (Shin Godzilla),"Those rampages -- staged by effects veteran Shinji Higuchi and his team, with co-director and sci-fi/fantasy maestro Hideaki Anno supervising -- are worth the wait.",2.5/5
7083,Godzilla Vs. Destoroyah,[It] may be the most action packed film in the whole series. It begins with the king ripping through Hong Kong and does not stop for a breath until the credits roll.,3.5/5
7084,Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah (Gojira tai Kingu Gidorâ),A guy in a monster suit destroys stuff. Fun!,3/5
7085,Godzilla Vs Mechagodzilla,"The film's plot is a bit ditzy all around, but it gets to the good stuff quickly.",7/10
7086,Godzilla vs. Megaguirus,A lively entry in the most recent series of Japanese Godzilla movies.,3/5
7087,Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla (Gojira vs. Supesugojira),"There IS an audience for these Godzilla flicks, but not from this corner.",1/5
7088,Godzilla's Revenge (All Monsters Attack),It is for desperate fans only and is pretty bad even by the loose standards of the genre.,0/5
7089,Goethe! (Young Goethe in Love),A doomed love affair that inspired a literary genius.,4/5
7090,Gogol Bordello Non-Stop,Non Stop doesn't know how to hit it and quit; it's a rock doc that screams loud and says frustratingly little.,2/5
7091,Goin' South,"With the Nicholson signature, it keeps on rolling, at least for the first hour and change before the story moves in the wrong direction.",76/100
7092,Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief,"There is a sense of latent awakening that Gibney manages to capture, and that's the most compelling part about 'Going Clear.' That dawning realization will be spreading soon enough, and that's clearly what terrifies the leadership of Scientology the most.",B+
7093,Going Down In La-la Land,The film can feel both refreshingly honest and embarrassingly Lifetime movie-like.,2.5/4
7094,Going in Style,Three veterans in a spotlight performance.,4/5
7095,Going in Style,"I'm hoping that Freeman, Caine and Arkin all have plenty of movies - and meatier roles - in their futures. In the meantime, it's a low-key pleasure to hang out with these guys, even in a movie that's only just good enough.",3/4
7096,Going My Way,"How come filmmakers 50 years ago could do sentiment without going all sappy, and we can't do that now?",9/10
7097,Going Places (Les valseuses),"A great film and a great comedy, casually offensive and distinctively, hilariously male.",5/5
7098,Going Shopping,"Typical Jaglom yakker, made fresh by winning performances from Lee Grant, Rob Morrow and Bruce Davison.",3/5
7099,Going Under,Going Under is mustier than Secretary.,2/4
7100,Gold,"Gold is fitfully entertaining, but for a movie that gives itself license to go bigger and weirder than real life, its imagination for excess runs out whenever it isn't focused intently on its star.",C+
7101,Gold Diggers of 1933,A fabulously fast-paced cynical comedy in which the straight parts of the movie are -- for a change -- nearly the equal in quality to the musical numbers.,5/5
7102,Gold Diggers of 1935,For the most part a smashing spectacle.,B+
7103,Gold Star,"Thin on the dramatics, but honest and warm and nicely-acted essay on youth confronting old age (in a parent)",2.5/4
7104,Elizabeth: The Golden Age,"Period films, even sequels, are limited by budget, and Kapur does a marvellous job with the money he has.",3.5/5
7105,The Golden Bowl,"Unfortunately, James' deft portrait of human frailty and his experimentation in narrative mode only intermittently find vivid expression in the work of Ivory and screenwriter Prawer Jhabvala.",C
7106,Golden Boy,"Performances are relaxed and realistic, never over-egging the more extreme elements that flutter around within each scene.",3/5
7107,The Golden Child,This film -- insignificant and lightweight and monumentally silly -- is entertaining from beginning to end.,3/4
7108,Golden Door (Nuovomondo),"Hung up on the nature of procedure, the film transpires in very distinct, hellish parts, as if moving slowly along the links of a great and heavy metal chain.",3.5/4
7109,Golden Exits,"No doubt Alex Ross Perry will follow up the film with a strong return to form, but this film is a collection of half-realized ideas and characters.",C-
7110,Golden Kingdom,"A profoundly lyrical film about life, death, and spirituality.",4/5
7111,The Golden Voyage of Sinbad,...may be fun for youngsters but a little trying for adults.,6/10
7112,GoldenEye,"Brosnan, in his debut, turns in a great performance as 007.",3.5/4

7114,Goldie,Goldie explodes with energy and hope.,B-
7115,"The Golem (Der Golem, wie er in die Welt kam)",This classic in horror is mainly enjoyed for its powerful visuals.,B+
7116,Golmaal Returns,Puerile is the first word that comes to mind when describing Golmaal Returns. As a sequel it manages to dive a few notches below the original.,2/5
7117,Golmaal 3,"This is, essentially a broad appeal, 'comedy for everyone', but what's intriguing about it, is the way Shetty and co. have fashioned a moral about the importance of family harmony, and the need to belong.",3/5
7118,Gomorrah (Gomorra),"The sheer pervasiveness of corruption is eye-opening, and it justifies the narrative structure somewhat, but it seems a slight point to be making over the course of two and a half hours.",51/100
7119,Gone,Gone is a mystery/thriller that is neither mysterious nor thrilling and proves Amanda Seyfried is quite a ways off at becoming a leading lady of quality entertainment.,2/5
7120,Gone Baby Gone,"Despite generic limitations of the adapted novel and lack of smooth storytelling, film has merits, signaling honorable debut of older brother Ben Affleck, and yet another strong turn, alongside Jesse James, from the younger Casey who should become a star.",B
7121,Gone Doggy Gone,"What Gone Doggy Gone has going for it, though, is solid banter writing and some crisp, engaging characterizations and acting.",B-
7122,Gone Fishin',"An unfunny, meandering film attempting to be a comedy.",0.5/4
7123,Gone Girl,"""Gone Girl"" will earn plenty of loud shouts of applause, awed sounds of surprise, and shocked laughter, but what makes it worthy of them is all the hushed, uneasy conversations it's guaranteed to inspire in the long, unsettled silence to come after.",4.5/5
7124,Gone With the Wind,This movie is pure soap opera. But what a soap opera!,4/4
7125,Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum,"Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum is the real deal. Deeply unsettling and unrelentingly scary, it is a film that must be seen.",4.5/5
7126,Gonzo: The Life and Work of Hunter S. Thompson,"It is at once a celebration of a genre-busting writer/rabble-rouser, and an elegy for a time period when a freak like Thompson could get access to political leaders and actually affect some kind of radical change.",3/4
7127,Gooby,"Instead of inspiring children to be brave and loving, it will most likely send them cowering under the covers in terror. They've already got Chucky movies for that.",1/4
7128,Good Advice,The best direct-to-video flick I've seen in ages.,3.5/5
7129,Good Boys,The film relies way too heavily on shock value while lacking any sort of actual substance.,3/10
7130,Good Burger,Avoid this study of stupidity like the plague.,1/5
7131,"Good Bye, Lenin!",Heartwarming comedy.,3.5/5
7132,A Good Day to Be Black & Sexy,A Good Day certainly shows Dortch as a talent to watch. Whether he does anything more with that talent will be up to him.,2.5/5
7133,Good Dick,Nearly blindsides us with moments of such genuine thoughtfulness and surprises that wouldn't be out-of-place in a script by Cameron Crowe or Richard Curtis.,3.5/4
7134,The Good Earth,Classic melodrama.,5/5
7135,Good for Nothing,"The title is apropos, but it's also an understatement.",0/4
7136,Good Fortune,"Upbeat story of a self-made millionaire who considers ""sharing"" his cash with worthy charities his life's work -- it only lacks a single skeptical second-guessing/fact-checking source or critic.",2.5/4
7137,The Good German,"50's stylishness through every bombed out alleyway, military office and underground hiding place. Blanchett is deliciously femme fatale, down to her black market stockings.",4/5
7138,The Good Guy,A light romantic comedy about a relationship between a hot-shot investment banker and a perky conservationist who learns in time that her boyfriend is a cad.,B
7139,Good Hair,"The subject matter would still be fairly interesting without Rock's involvement, but the comedian brings a accessibility to the material that no amount of facts and figures can replace.",3.5/5
7140,Good Kids,"It's not a great first feature for McCoy, but it's surely a competent one that speaks loudly -- and somewhat profanely -- to a budding talent with intriguing possibilities.",B-
7141,Good Kill,"In the face of such a weighty topic, Niccol proves a poor co-pilot for himself, as Good Kill's script fails to live up to a strong directorial effort.",6/10
7142,Good Luck Chuck,"Just when you think things can't possibly get worse, they do. And then some.",0/5
7143,A Good Man in Africa,"This plot, and the attitudes that underlie it, remind me of the patronizing tone of novels set in Africa 50 years ago, about colorful colonials and backward natives. The movie is not overtly racist. But there is an unpleasant undertone.",2/4
7144,Good Morning (Ohayô),"As an introduction to Ozu, it's a perfect film. And, in addition, I think it has more to offer artistically than its reputation would suggest.",4/4
7145,"Good Morning, Vietnam",Williams is a virtuoso.,4/4
7146,The Good Mother (The Price of Passion),The Good Mother is one of the most confused and conflicted serious movies in a long time -- a film that feels great passion about its subject matter but has no idea what it wants to say or how to say it.,1/4
7147,Good Neighbor Sam,"Good, frantic fun.",3.5/5
7148,Good Neighbors,A wickedly funny noir.,3/4
7149,Good News,Bouncy MGM college-themed musical sparkles with June Allyson.,4/5
7150,The Good Night,"Jake Paltrow's script is clever, though, and the ideas he's trying to explore are interesting.",3/5
7151,Good Ol' Freda,"The doc will prove fascinating only to the die-hard fans that Freda Kelly spent years writing to, though in this case that's no small number of people.",2/4
7152,Good People,It only overcomes its deficiencies and gains a modicum of entertainment value precisely when it commits to its illogical storylines and exaggerated plot twists.,1.5/4
7153,Good Sam,Good Sam explores whether it's possible to find a person capable of doing a good deed selflessly. What unfolds is a heartwarming mystery about unconditional generosity.,3/5
7154,The Good Shepherd,I've seen glaciers with a faster pace and better focused on its intrigue.,3/5
7155,The Good Son,"The movie is a creepy, unpleasant experience, made all the worse because it stars children too young to understand the horrible things we see them doing.",0.5/4
7156,Good Time,Pattinson makes you root for his character from the start.,4/5
7157,Good Will Hunting,"Good Will Hunting is stuffed -- indeed, overstuffed -- with heart, soul, audacity, and blarney. You may not believe a minute of it, but you don't necessarily want to stop watching.",B
7158,A Good Woman,...instantly forgettable...,2/4
7159,A Good Year,"Where A Good Year is headed is obvious before the opening frame, but working from a warm script, Ridley Scott directs mostly genuine performances to keep us interested",3/5
7160,Goodbye Charlie,"Funny but far-fetched entertainment from director Minnelli, who doesn't need to rely on strange plot devices to make a good movie.",2.5/5
7161,Goodbye Christopher Robin,Goodbye Christopher Robin will make you cry - and it may just ruin your childhood forever.,4/5
7162,"Goodbye, Columbus","Nobody ever talks about the underrated Goodbye, Columbus, but they should.",4/5
7163,Goodbye Lover,A poorly-paced bland crime drama that has all the twists and turns of a 'Bewitched' episode.,1/5
7164,Goodbye Solo,"The life-affirming dialogue easily draws the audience into the funky surroundings of Winston-Salem, North Carolina.",B+
7165,Goodbye to All That,"Goodbye To All That never dares to sentimentalize, but the performances and tones are so well played that the movie is tenderly wistful in all the exact moments",A-
7166,Goodbye World,Goodbye World feigns intelligence from the very first frame...hoping that snappy dialogue and charming performances can allow us to forgive its utter lack of ambition or thought,C-
7167,"Goodnight Mommy (Ich seh, Ich seh)",Every minute that goes by ratchets up the mystery and the unease.,3/5
7168,"The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard","The comedy concept is solid... It's the execution that's out of alignment in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard.",C+

7174,The Goonies,"Loud music, even louder kids, loud sound effects make for one of the most annoying motion pictures ever made.",1/5
7175,Goosebumps,"Goofily self-aware and wholesomely boisterous, it's a children's picture whose sense of spooky fun readily diverts from its quibble-worthy messaging.",70/100
7176,Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween,Take the candy you are most indifferent to and pretend it's what you just got in your trick-or-treat basket; that's what to expect here,2/5
7177,Gordy,"A lot happens, it moves quickly, and the film is filled with minor characters who nicely round things out; my young companion watched the film from beginning to end, loving it.",2.5/5
7178,Gore Vidal: The United States Of Amnesia,"Wrathall's considered, thorough and thoroughly entertaining film gives not just a sense of the man but also the importance to the world of iconoclasts like him.",4.5/5

7180,Gori Tere Pyaar Mein,"Facile, predictable and boring.",2/4
7181,Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey,"There were moments when I felt a touch of awe. Those moments, which are genuine, make the movie worth seeing.",3/4
7182,Gorky Park,"It remains a taut, clever thriller throughout, with Mr. Apted's direction establishing its intensity immediately and sustaining it well.",3/5

7184,The Gospel,"A banal, artless, clich-ridden fiction.",1.5/4
7185,Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo (The Gospel According to St. Matthew),"what Pasolini's simple, bleak vision proves is that small and spare is really no more effective than glorious and overblown when trying to adapt the Gospels to the screen",2/4
7186,Gospel Hill,"It's hard to say harsh things about a movie as earnest and well intentioned as Gospel Hill. But we've got to do what we've got to do, now, don't we?",61/100
7187,Gossip,"Has many intriguing elements that might have equaled up to more in a tighter screenplay, but it ultimately doesn't satisfy once the end credits have begun to roll.",2/4

7190,Gottfried Helnwein and the Dreaming Child,Much of the doc plays like a moderately well produced but tediously uncritical making-of feature that could easily have been included on the opera's DVD release.,2.5/5
7191,Gotti,"The problem is that it's not really anything. This is a strange thing to say about a notorious mob boss who was locked up for murder, but John Gotti deserved better.",D
7192,The Governess,"The Governess could be an illustration of the ideas in Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, in which she marvels at how necessary it is for men to have women to feel superior to.",3/4
7193,Goya's Ghosts,click for full review,2.5/5
7194,Grabbers,One of those rare horror films with an unimprovable premise: its pack of blood-sucking aliens are fatally allergic to human blood that contains a significant percentage of alcohol.,4/5
7195,Grace Is Gone,"Grace is Gone is a film that depends entirely on whether you feel empathy for its characters. Luckily, John Cusack's brilliant performance as Stan captures the experience of a newly bereaved husband whose wife dies while serving in Iraq.",3.5/5
7196,Grace of My Heart,"It's a big role and [Douglas is] equal to it -- but is the movie? I would have preferred a more limited story that went deeper, instead of a docudrama that covers so much ground, so relentlessly, that we grow weary.",2.5/4

7206,Grand Hotel,"It hasn't aged as well as some Oscar-winners, but neither is it as dated as, for example, Cimarron.",3/4
7207,Grand Piano,"Probably the best Brian De Palma movie he never made, ""Grand Piano"" expands the boundaries of single-location, real-time mysteries like ""Phone Booth"" and ""Panic Room"" with a brilliantly simple concept and nimble, elegant style.",A-

7210,Grandma,A perfectly pleasant mix of humor and drama that will remind you how much Lily Tomlin is missed as a regular fixture in movies.,7/10
7211,Grandma's Boy,"As a short it could have emerged as inspired, but as a feature it feels tired, deflated, and far too familiar.",D+
7212,The Grapes of Wrath,"John Ford's adaptation of the John Steinbeck novel is moving and heartfelt, despite its random structure and rambling, overwrought (and overly political) narrative.",4/5
7213,Grass,"The film is unlikely to tell many of its viewers anything they don't already know, and unlikely to change our national drug policy.",2/4
7214,The Grass Harp,"Star power isn't a problem in this episodic rendering of Truman Capote's novel. A scattershot story without focus is, which is why the film soon evaporates from the memory.",1.5/4

7216,Grass Is Greener,"In Greener's view, until those most affected by the War on Drugs are put in a position to directly benefit from legalization, it's not really accomplishing anything at all.",B
7217,Grassroots,"A witty, well-cast, sometimes ingeniously paced political comedy.",3/4
7218,Grateful Dawg,"Their music together is certainly pleasant enough, but, unless you're a fan of bluegrass, you may find it as sleep inducing as I did.",2.5/4
7219,Grave Encounters,A ghost of a different color turns the gurneys on a hip TV production.,6/10
7220,Grave Encounters 2,"Grave Encounters 2 delivers a sick, intense, and scary white-knuckled spookshow that reveres the groundwork set up by the original and expands upon it on every level.",3.5/5

7222,The Gravedancers,An exacting ghost story wielding an old school fright mentality...,3.5/5
7223,Gravity,"Gravity is very much an action adventure film, one very occasionally more meditative than most, but it's unashamed in its desire to thrill you.",A
7224,Gravy,"Much too self-consciously zany to be funny, ""Gravy"" is best approached as a celebration of make-up achievements.",C
7225,Gray's Anatomy,"The movie version of Gray's material seems arch, contrived and starchy, not the spontaneous eruption that his theater work manages to resemble.",2/4

7227,Grease 2,"In its sheer awfulness, it is one of the best camp entertainments you could ever find.",0/4
7228,Grease: Live!,"Despite its innovative direction and talented cast, Grease: Live fell victim to its bland source material - and equally bland leads - leaving it unable to truly top other iterations of the modern TV musical.",6/10
7229,Greaser's Palace,"The film, I'm told, cost close to $1-million, and it looks it, which depresses me even more than its witlessness.",1/5

7239,The Great Outdoors,Two funny guys delivering very few laughs.,2.5/5
7240,The Great Raid,"Except for a silly fictional love story that demeans Margaret Utinsky's heroism, this is the best war movie ever, vividly contrasting Japanese bestiality with American valor.",10/10
7241,The Great Santini,Offers a whole lot more than just Duvall's flawless performance.,4.5/5
7242,The Great Waldo Pepper,"It doesn't have any big notions about the passing of that era, or of the barnstormers, who are seen as overgrown kids with wonderful toys that fly. But it has a good feeling for the period, and director George Roy Hill gives us poignancy and adventure.",3/4
7243,The Great White Hype,"As satire, Hype dares to play the race card but folds too soon.",2/4
7244,Great World of Sound,"In terms of humor, the film proves frustratingly top-heavy.",2/4

7249,The Greatest Story Ever Told,The most unintentionally hilarious biblical epic ever to grace the silver screen.,55/100
7250,Greed,Winterbottom chucks everything up to and including the kitchen sink into this movie: sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.,3/5
7251,Greedy,"The movie has a promising first act, and then makes the mistake of taking its silly story seriously, with dreadful results: The last two-thirds of this movie plays like a sitcom without the laugh track -- or the laughs.",2/4
7252,Greedy Lying Bastards,"A serious, hard-hitting doc that eviscerates the know-nothings who claim that global warming, if it exists at all, has little to do with the activities of big corporations.",B+
7253,Green Book,"A touching and meaningful look at race and class in America, the likes of which studios rarely produce anymore.",B
7254,Green Card,"Even so, at its heart this movie is, like Pretty Woman, very tired stuff tarted up in glad rags.",C
7255,Green Dragon,"Green Dragon falls prey to some threadbare Hollywood conventions, but otherwise maintains a high level of maturity and emotion as it examines the lives of Vietnamese refugees entering America in 1975.",B
7256,Green for Danger,An unfairly overlooked delight in the annals of British film history.,5/5
7257,The Green Hornet,"[S]hows a kind of ambition that's rare in superhero flicks. It's ambitious in the ""let's make something that's funny and original and cool and exciting"" sense. Not the ""let's spend 100million on flying CGI robots, and to hell with ideas"" sense.",4/5
7258,Green Lantern,"A film that's all set-up and no pay-off: an origin story for a hero we don't much care for with an elaborate lore we have zero interest in, toplined by a star who's little more than a torso and a smirk.",2/5
7259,Green Lantern: First Flight,The story's action and adventure move along at the pace you'd expect from a direct-to-video animation.,5/10
7260,The Green Mile,The worst I can say about this thoroughly decent movie is that it botches some of the most important scenes.,B
7261,The Green Pastures,"In many ways, this is one of the best biblical films ever done. Mostly because it doesn't preach, just entertains, and in doing that, puts its lessons across with a minimum of effort.",3.5/5
7262,Green Room,"There's also a thick vein of dark humour that runs through the film which never turns it into a comedy but keeps some of the nastier moments (and boy, are they nasty) from turning it into torture porn.",4/5
7263,The Green Slime,Hysterically bad sci-fi with an even worse theme song.,2/5
7264,Green Street Hooligans,"As the film progresses and as Matt falls deeper and deeper into the firm, you can honestly believe that the transformation is real.",4/5
7265,Greenberg,"Although Ben Stiller's brand of nervy comic ticks can prove irritating on occasions, here he is kept in check so that the humor and the pathos shine through.",3/5

7268,Greenlight,Greenlight is a tight thriller with some thrilling twists and you should catch it before it blows up big.,8/10
7269,Greenwich Village: Music That Defined a Generation,"The film's pleasures are the same ones offered by a sprawling, lavishly illustrated magazine spread.",3/5
7270,Greetings From Tim Buckley,'Greetings From Tim Buckley' would actually work much better as a play.,4/10
7271,Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters,"An engaging portrait of a fascinating artist, it is difficult if not impossible to look away from once it gets going -- much like Crewdson's astonishing photographs.",4/5
7272,Gregory's Girl,"What could have been a charming film about pining, becomes a confusing mess of multiple storylines that really don't amount to anything.",66/100
7273,Gremlins,"The pitch black comedy works, and it makes you wonder how a generation of parents took their kids to see this -- as children's entertainment -- without question. Ah, salad days.",4/5
7274,Gremlins 2: The New Batch,Too many gremlins and not enough story line.,2.5/4

7283,Il Grido (The Cry),The beautifully desolate cinematography is rich in its gray color palette.,4/5
7284,Griff the Invisible,"It would be easy to dismiss Griff The Invisible as just another ""quirky"" Australian dramedy, but it's more than that. As an exploration of the collision between dreams and delusions, between loneliness and love, it's wonderful.",4/5
7285,The Grifters,"This is a movie of plot, not episode. It's not just a series of things that happen to the characters, but a web, a maze of consequences.",4/4
7286,Grigris,"Ultimately too spare to completely satisfy, the pronounced feeling coming out of this film is that it needs more dancing.",C-
7287,Gringo,...ironic entertainment that works like a Swiss watch. [Full Review in Spanish],3/5
7288,Gringo Trails,"Pegi Vail beautifully edited film somehow addresses a lot, but ultimately says little.",2.5/4
7289,Touchez Pas au Grisbi (Hands Off the Loot),A masterfully done film noir.,A
7290,Grizzly Man,"A heartbreaking cautionary tale for those who ""love"" nature more than they ""understand"" it.",4.5/5

7292,The Groomsmen,"It has been a dozen years since The Brothers McMullen, yet Burns still has no clue how to make movies.",0/5
7293,Groove,"With unreal characters that utter meaningless dialog, the movie drifts along on a drug-induced cloud of blissful shallowness.",4/10
7294,Gross Anatomy,"The university atmosphere is reproduced with relentless accuracy, right down to the most subtle intonations in the voices of the professors setting the exams and asking the questions. And all of the dialogue has the ring of truth.",3/4
7295,Grosse Pointe Blank,...a quirky high-caliber dark comedy that is bound to send your cynicism and funnybone to the same repair shop. Grosse Pointe Blank is so effortless in its relentless send-up of everyday drivel,3.5/4
7296,Ground Control,"Air-traffic control drama has lots of tension, profanity.",3/5
7297,Groundhog Day,"This movie has all the qualities necessary to be a crowd-pleaser: likable characters, charismatic performers, a strong, capably-executed premise, and lots of laughs.",3.5/4
7298,Growing Up Smith (Good Ol' Boy),"This immigrant clash-of-generations set-up risks falling into clich, and sometimes does, but director Frank Lotito and the screenwriters find enough specificity and comedy in Smith's dilemma to keep the genial, family-friendly story afloat.",A
7299,Grown Up Movie Star,"Grown Up Movie Star is unruly, tortured, crisis-prone, nervy, melodramatic and just charming enough to make you forgive all of the above. It's like a teenager that way.",3.5/5
7300,Grown Ups,"Adam Sandler spends more time laughing at jokes than making them in Grown Ups, perhaps the slackest, shabbiest comedy in the star's increasingly dreadful oeuvre.",0.5/4
7301,Grown Ups 2,"Another lowbrow make-work project for Sandler's jock cronies, SNL has-been hangers-on and Dan Patrick.",1.5/4
7302,The Grudge 2,"The only place Takashi doesn't stuff his powdery ghosts is up a cheerleader's skirt, surprising since there are so many of them readily available.",3/5
7303,Grudge Match,"Grudge Match yells a lot and maniacally yanks at the heartstrings like a buzzard ripping out soft tissue, but even the in-ring battle choreography is abysmal. It's all pretty depressing, to be truthful.",0/5
7304,Grumpier Old Men,A wheezier replay of the 1993 hit geezer romp Grumpy Old Men.,2/4
7305,Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever,A cross between a crass piece of holiday marketing and the kind of thing that might air on Adult Swim in the middle of the night.,2/5
7306,Grumpy Old Men,"Relaxed, valedictory, exquisitely titled, Grumpy Old Men feels like an odd couple's last hurrah.",B
7307,In Bloom,"The foreclosure of possibilities provided by the use of the long take assists in the indictment of chauvinism and patriarchal brutality that underpin, directly and indirectly, many moments in the film.",3/4
7308,GTFO: Get the F&#% Out,GTFO is as important as it is frightening.,6/10
7309,Guardians of the Galaxy,"One of the most entertaining, fun, thrilling, heartfelt and beautiful summer blockbusters we've seen.",5/5
7310,Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"From the obligatory Stan Lee cameo to the also-obligatory post-credits sequences, Marvel knows its audience.",3/5
7311,Guarding Tess,"There are lots of laughs in this picture, and though at one point he teeters perilously on the brink of mush and gush, Wilson manages to regain his gently caustic comic footing.",3/5
7312,Güeros,"The film's social commentary unspools quietly in the background while the narrative focuses on the ennui, free-floating anxiety, and inchoate longing for meaning experienced by two or three privileged young people from the middle- to upper-middle classes.",3/4
7313,Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst,A fascinating trip down memory lane.,3/4
7314,Guess Who,"The jokes may be weak, but the social context the gags broadcast with them comes in surprisingly strong.",3.5/5
7315,Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"As an opus on race relations, Dinner certainly seems a bit daring, but it's just not standing the test of time terribly well.",3.5/5
7316,Guest Artist,"Self-important character study has drinking, pot use.",2/5
7317,Guest of Cindy Sherman,"A latter-day exemplar of the postmodern exercise wherein tangential characters become protagonists, Guest of Cindy Sherman is a fascinatingly flawed and balloon-headed study of an unlikely encounter with greatness.",2/4
7318,Guest of Honour,Even at its most perversely entertaining - this very unpredictable movie only feels as if it's working in spite of itself.,C+
7319,Guidance,"Mills skilfully sets up characters and situations, draws strong work from his cast of mostly locals (expert at playing straight-faced) and makes fine use throughout of a silly motivational recording David's seen making in the first scene.",3/5
7320,The Guilty,...the ending has one of the best twists I've seen in a while.,3/4
7321,Guilty as Sin,"Probably worth seeing on a slow night, but only if you want to keep things that way.",2.5/4
7322,Guilty by Suspicion,It teaches a lesson we are always in danger of forgetting: that the greatest service we can do our country is to be true to our conscience.,3.5/4
7323,Guilty Of Romance,"Sono's wicked sense of humour still runs throughout Guilty of Romance, but there are also literary references to Franz Kafka's The Castle, a murder that would not have been out of place in Se7en and a whole lot of sex.",3.5/5
7324,Gulliver's Travels,"Not only tolerable, but actually - *gasp* - enjoyable. [...] The 3D is better employed here than it was in Tron: Legacy.",3.5/5
7325,The Gumball Rally,"Although we are all going to have the greatest difficulty even remembering the name of The Gumball Rally in three months' time, it is a pleasant, slick, inoffensive entertainment.",2.5/4

7329,Gun Shy,"The supporting cast is comical, and anyone enjoying the misadventures of dumb lawbreakers should get a kick out of this movie.",6/10
7330,Gun Shy,It's loud and dumb and irritating and forgettable.,1.5/4
7331,Guncrazy,A not-bad 'B' movie.,3/5
7332,Gundala,"The first half of the movie is particularly impressive, as writer-director Joko Anwar does a great job establishing the younger Sancaka during his gritty childhood era.",3/5
7333,Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,At best an effective Western.,C+
7334,Gunga Din,"Gunga Din has a bit of everything -- humor, suspense, spectacle, action and a heavy dose of racism, imperialism and xenophobia.",5/5
7335,Gunless,"Gunless is certainly eager to please. Yet for all of its broad humour and cheeky pleas to patriotism, the laughs in this comedy prove to be scarcer than teeth in Gabby Hayes' head.",2/5
7336,Gunnin' for That #1 Spot,Easily the best movie of its kind since Steve James' Hoop Dreams.,4/5

7338,The Guns of Navarone,...epic grandeur with unabashed heroism.,8/10
7339,Guru,"Even if you have never heard of [Dhirubhai] Ambani or know little about India and its history, you can still appreciate GURU for its terrific cast and its strong direction and script.",B+
7340,Gut,"Unfolding in awkward diner conversations and uncomfortable bedroom scenes, ""Gut"" has a cold, flat look that gives even a child's stuffed toy a sinister sheen.",1/5
7341,Guy and Madeline on a Park Bench,One of the most underproduced musicals of this or any other year.,C-
7342,Guy X,Jason Biggs (doomed to have some variation of the words 'pie-botherer' in every article ever written about him thanks to the American Pie movies) makes a successful leap from comedy to drama here.,2/5
7343,Guys and Balls,"This jubilant, exhilarating film works like a wonder tonic. It's as captivating as they come, by its very definition a big, fat, fantastic crowd pleaser.",5/5
7344,Guys and Dolls,...may have been more than a bit outdated even when it was first released in 1955.,6/10
7345,Guzaarish,Its largely unsentimental treatment of its doomed protagonist results in a surprisingly uplifting weepie.,4/5
7346,Gwen,"Clever, beautiful and well-acted, Gwen proves to be an unexpected delight. It's a slow burn, but one worth seeking out.",4.5/5
7347,Gymkata,"Hey, you got your gymnastics in my karate! No, YOU got your karate in my ... oh never mind. You just won't find a movie much stupider than this one.",1/5

7349,When the Road Bends: Tales of a Gypsy Caravan,Only the Taliban could dislike the joyful music on display herein.,B+
7350,H,"H sets up its enigmatic premise with a gruesome style and intensity, and finally ties up the mystery with ... well, nothing a little suspension of disbelief can't fix.",3/4
7351,H2: Halloween II,It feels a little more like a trick than a treat.,4.5/10
7352,Ha-shoter (Policeman),"Director Nadav Lapid, in his feature debut, over-emphasizes the rituals of machismo, from the back slapping (thump, thump, thump) to the fetishizing of guns that carries over the entire film.",2/4
7353,Habermann,"A portrait of a town that never feels completely real, devoid of normality or everyday activity, a depiction which undercuts the eventual emotional escalation.",2.5/4
7354,Habit,"The movie is done in a flat, realistic tone that is perfectly suited to the material.",3/4
7355,Hachi: A Dog's Tale,"A circular routine of smiles and tears, Hachi is delightfully gentle and engaging, refusing to bloat the material past an elementary message of canine loyalty.",B+
7356,Hackers,"What's uncovered beneath the flashy skin is an old-fashioned, film-by-numbers thriller.",2/4
7357,Hacksaw Ridge,"A gruesome, pounding war film about the courage of a deeply religious man in near-unbelievable circumstances.",3/5
7358,Hagazussa: A Heathen's Curse (Hagazussa),"He's captured this moment in time, this draining and ugly paranoia that caused women such misery, with imagery that is perplexingly beautiful.",4
7359,Haiku Tunnel,"Without Woody Allen in the cast, this movie is afflicted with tunnel vision.",2/4
7360,"Hail, Caesar!","A day in the life of a movie ""fixer"" forms the unifying bond in a delightful film that satirizes and pays homage as well to 1950s pictures.",B+
7361,"Je Vous Salue, Marie (Hail Mary)",The film is not very good. People who have not seen a lot of films by Godard will find it especially slow-moving.,1.5/4
7362,Hail the Conquering Hero,"Still worth seeing, as always, because of that amazing Sturges dialogue.",3/4
7363,Hair,"Treat Williams delivered a great performance as Berger, and showshe doesn't deserve to be stuck in TV movies like he is now.",4/5
7364,Hair High,Hair High is the actually the artist's most cohesive 'story' to date...which means it's only about 35% weirder than any other sort of animation out there.,4/5
7365,HairBrained,"Too bad that the film's funniest personalities, Parker Posey and Fred Melamed, have the smallest parts.",C+
7366,Hairspray,"A much-needed respite from summer's big, noisy, special effects adventures, Hairspray is old-fashioned fun, wearing its retro like a badge of honor; the ""coolest"" thing about this uplifting musical is how mainstream it is.",B+
7367,"Hale County This Morning, This Evening","Ross has a preternatural talent for capturing moments, souls and unorthodox time-lapses. Every shot seems to maximize the cinematographic potential of the scene through dexterous camerawork, while excellent sound collaging matches the scattered visuals.",9/10

7369,Half a Sixpence,"As beautifully smiling faces waver gently in and out of focus, the sound track drips honey and molasses and horehound drops. Oh love, oh life, ah happy fate, that we, who have split this sixpence in twain as mere youths, should meet again, etc.",2/4

7443,HappyThankYouMorePlease,"The script is intermittently literate and frequently funny, the young cast (headed by Radnor) is highly appealing, and you can definitely imagine this movie finding a niche with a subset of the audience that turned (500) Days of Summer into a sleeper hit",3/5
7444,Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai,"It doesn't help that Miike shot Hara-Kiri in 3-D, which as usual accomplishes nothing save for making the action look as if it's taking place during a partial eclipse of the sun.",C+

7446,Harbinger Down,"Gillis clearly had some ideas for practical effects he wanted to create; the plot is just an excuse to do them. There doesn't appear to be much sincere interest in telling a story. For this reason, Harbinger Down plays like the world's longest demo reel.",1/4

7461,Hardcore Henry,"The most shocking part of the whole film isn't that it's heart-poundingly intense (it is) or that it feels new and inventive (it does that too), but that it's at times pretty damn witty with some terrific story beats (no, really).",B+

7488,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"A remarkable achievement... moving, funny, honest and true and sad and sweet. A movie about characters who we have come to know and love, and a movie that understands that it's these characters, and not the magic they perform, that is the real hook.",9.5/10

7729,The Golden Compass,"As a children's fable, the film lacks magic, due to Weitz's uninspired helming and uneven technical execution, but it's likable, moderately engaging and well-acted by Dakota Blue Richards and Nicole Kidman; too bad Daniel Craig has such a tiny part.",C+

7746,Hitman,A movie so bland it's hard to believe it was inspired by anything more than a Wikipedia entry on 'action thrillers.',2/5
7747,Hitman: Agent 47,"It's so coldblooded, it's practically reptilian.",1.5/4
7748,The Hobbit,"A faithful and well-executed take on Tolkien's classic fairy tale. Though geared towards younger audiences, it should appeal to fans of any age.",4/5
7749,Hobo With a Shotgun,At times I found myself doubled over in hysteria at the complete insanity of the carnage I was watching on-screen. HOBO was a blast!,9/10
7750,Hockney,"Wright's film is warm, entertaining, and a great window into Hockney's work.",4/5
7751,Hocus Pocus,It's acceptable scary-silly kid fodder that adults will find only mildly insulting. Unless they're Bette Midler fans. In which case it's depressing as hell.,C-
7752,Hoffa,Hoffa shows DeVito as a genuine filmmaker. Here is a movie that finds the right look and tone for its material. Not many directors would have been confident enough to simply show us Jimmy Hoffa instead of telling us all about him.,3.5/4
7753,Hold the Dark,"A brutal slog of a film, admirable in its fearlessness in terms of dark subject matter, but the brutality doesn't feel worth it in the end.",2.5/4
7754,Holding The Man,"The film's commanding achievement is probably tonal: there is a warm, sensual flow to it, with production values that feel amorous and tactile.",2/5
7755,Holding Trevor,Brings back bad memories of Nearing Grace while tainting fond ones of Catcher in the Rye.,1.5/4
7756,"Hål i mitt hjärta, Ett (A Hole In My Heart)",Sends your brain whirring as well as your stomach churning -- quite a feat.,4/5

7761,Holiday Inn,"Holiday Inn, is, of course, filled with the kind of pretty Christmas songs and picture-postcard scenes of snow and horse-drawn sleighs that make for beloved holiday movies. But there's also some darkness lurking here.",9/10
7762,Holidays,"""Holidays"" is an exciting idea that appears to have been pieced together without the proper time to develop and realize its thrilling potential.",2/4
7763,Hollow,"Solid, largely naturalistic performances and a nice technical package offset, if only for hardcore genre enthusiasts, a story whose bump-in-the-night eeriness reaches a level of diminishing return long before its end.",C+
7764,Hollow Man,Verhoeven -- no doubt alarmed by the poor box-office showing of his last few films -- is clearly out to pander to a teenage audience.,C-
7765,Hollow Man 2,"Essentially a goofy little matinee flick for the FX geeks and the schlock-obsessed sequel-lovers, HM2 isn't nearly as bad as it could have been ... but it's pretty darn disposable all the same.",2.5/5
7766,Holly,"The dramatization of child sexual slavery comes across more involved in education than entertainment, its tone less melodramatic than what we found in 'Trade.'",B-
7767,Hollywood Ending,Just the film that could help revive the sluggish New York tourist industry.,3/4
7768,Hollywood Homicide,Harrison Ford and Josh Hartnett are...a veritably delightful and likable duo that mesh surprisingly well with each other.,2.5/4
7769,The Hollywood Knights,"One horrendous film--a shapeless, formless mess with little story and even less sense.",0/4
7770,Hollywood Shuffle,"Under the circumstances, Hollywood Shuffle is an artistic compromise but a logistical triumph, announcing the arrival of a new talent whose next movie should really be something.",3/4
7771,Hollywood to Dollywood,This is a charmer of a film and well worth catching.,4/5
7772,Hollywoodland,"Turns Reeves' life into a multi-layered, gumshoe murder mystery and achieves something altogether unique.",4.5/5
7773,Holmes and Watson,It's just frustrating that Holmes and Watson has a handful of moments of genuine comic lunacy - a seconds-long Elephant Man cameo is inspired - but all they really do is highlight the laziness and lack of laughs in the rest of the film.,2/5
7774,Holy Ghost People,Snakes in the Pulpit!,3/4
7775,Holy Man,"I love movies. I'd rather watch movies than do almost anything else. So if I write that I walked out on a movie, what could be a more clear statement?",0/4
7776,Holy Motors,It's hard to imagine anyone enjoying their popcorn when confronted with a naked man with an erection eating Eva Mendes's hair.,B+
7777,The Holy Mountain,"The mise-en-scene is packed with colorful, often shocking images (blood and body wastes are recurring motifs) but orchestrated in a creative delirium.",2/4
7778,Holy Rollers,"Weaves a quiet, ethnographic spell, highlighted by a brave and detailed central performance from Jesse Eisenberg.",3/5
7779,Holy Smoke,"Although the cinematography by Dion Beebe is beautiful, and most of the performances click, Campion never really gets to the point of what she's trying to say. It's all too vague.",3/5
7780,Hombre,"For as much as Hombre is a film of its time, it endures as an example of how deeper examinations of the rifts that divide individuals and nations are forever contemporary.",3.5/4
7781,Home Page,"A documentary not nearly intimate enough in its portrait of the people the film inhabits. For webaholics, at least its never boring, even at a prolonged 102 minutes.",2/4
7782,Home,"A smart, engaging and superbly acted indie drama that knows and shows its title can be not just a physical place but a state of settled mind.",A-
7783,Home,"Home's infantilism is a regressive step for DreamWorks, offering a sour rather than sweet experience for audiences.",2/5
7784,Home Again,"Reese Witherspoon's oversized appeal and radiance is no match for ""Home Again,"" a ramshackle romcom short on both romance and laughs.",2/5
7785,Home Alone,The movie devolves into an egregious Three Stooges painfest: We're meant to giggle and clap along with Kevin as the crooks get their heads singed with blowtorches and walk barefoot on glass.,D
7786,Home Alone 2: Lost in New York,"Be a champ, protect your child from this brutal cartoon of a movie. If you don't, you may end up like Marv and Harry (Stern and Pesci) -- suffering the consequences.",0/5
7787,Home Alone 3,"To my astonishment, I liked the third Home Alone movie better than the first two; I'm even going so far as to recommend it, although not to grownups unless they are having a very silly day.",3/4

7789,Home Fries,"The actors are tickled by their characters and have fun with them, and so I did, too.",3/4
7790,Home from the Hill,"Along with Some Came Running, it ranks as Minnelli's finest family melodrama, lurid and flamboyant yet also deeply emotional and incisive in its critique of the patriarchal order; Robert Mitchum as the patriarch is superb.",A
7791,Home of the Brave,"Except for the Iraqi action prologue, it's a stretch to say this is any more than a run-of-the-mill TV movie. Worthy assignment; poor execution.",2.5/5
7792,Home on the Range,There is a noticeable stench in the air when the movie makes a reference to Billy Bob Thornton's performance in Sling Blade. It's stale ink.,2/4
7793,Home Room,Not only awful but also possessed of the potential for being truly offensive to the victims of the atrocities off which it pings.,1/4
7794,Home Run,"Well-cast but thinly scripted faith-based dramedy about baseball, booze and redemption",2/4
7795,Home Sweet Hell,"Heigl and Wilson do their best to salvage a sinking ship, putting in fine performances that embrace ghoulishness director Anthony Burns eventually turns away from.",C
7796,Homecoming: A Film by Beyoncé,Homecoming deserves consideration as one of the great concert movies of all time.,4/4
7797,Homefront,"The material plays out like a particularly busy episode of Sons of Anarchy, possessing a peculiar joylessness that's anathema to the success of films like this.",1.5/4
7798,Homegrown,"Homegrown is a lovable off-the-wall film that, probably, very few have seen or even heard about.",B+
7799,Homer & Eddie,"Directed by Andrei Konchalovsky, whose concept of subtlety most people would mistake for a sledge hammer or pneumatic drill.",0/5
7800,Homeward Bound II - Lost in San Francisco,It's more padded than Lassie's bed. But 9-and-unders were having a tail-wagging good time.,2.5/4
7801,Homeward Bound - The Incredible Journey,"having suffered with my human through the dim-witted Beethoven and the dreadful Bingo, I found Homeward Bound to be a breath of animal-oriented realism, voice-overs or no.",B

7805,Honey,"Snaps, crackles and pops along to a dynamic beat",3/5
7806,Honey 2,"For all its killer choreography, alas, it's clear this genre urgently needs some new moves of its own.",2/5

7809,"Honey, We Shrunk Ourselves!","Honey, this series is starting to suck!",1/5
7810,Honeydripper,"The scenes involving musical performances...are the best parts of the movie, and it would be much enriched if there were more of them.",7/10
7811,Honeyglue,"Has its bad and pompous moments, but it also feels lived-in and genuine.",4/5
7812,Honeymoon,"It's creepy as hell, the kind of movie that worms its way underneath your skin and sits there.",B+
7813,Honeymoon in Vegas,"The plot is dumb enough to be a sitcom, but Bergman isn't dumb enough to make it one; he has a way of finding comedy in the urgency of driven characters.",3.5/4
7814,The Honeymoon Killers,A landmark shockumentary,4/5
7815,Honkytonk Man,Clint Eastwood's dust bowl drama Honkytonk Man is a sensitive road picture about a mostly luckless aspiring country music singer.,3/4
7816,Honor Flight,"Inflated to feature length and devoid of nuance or fresh insights, it just seems self-congratulatory - aren't we great for having done this for these old guys? - and exploitive.",2/5
7817,Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil,"Despite ample proof to the contrary, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil was not written by the punaholic Carrie Bradshaw.",0.5/4
7818,Hook,"Amid all this flexing of moviemaking muscle, there's possible evidence of uncertainty as well.",2/5
7819,Hooked,"The script is far too obvious for its own good, shouting its opinions instead of drawing us in meaningfully.",2.5/5
7820,Hooking Up,A sex comedy in which you can like the cast even as you give up on the movie. Early.,1.5/4
7821,Hoop Dreams,This picture has a legitimate dramatic structure that is equally as compelling as a scripted slice of fiction.,3.5/4
7822,Hoosiers,It's a movie that is all heart.,4/4
7823,Hoot,...deplorable...ludicrous,1/10
7824,Hop,Looks suspiciously like a cack Santa flick in which the fat red guy's been switched with a talking rabbit.,2/5
7825,Hope Floats,"This material could obviously lead in a lot of different directions. It seems most promising as comedy or satire, but no: Hope Floats is a turgid melodrama with the emotional range of a sympathy card.",2/4
7826,Hope Springs,A date movie that's well worth making a date with.,3/5
7827,Hope Springs,"The therapy in Maine with recommended intimacy exercises for a couple married 31 years will be found hysterically funny by some, embarrassing by others, and for me, well-acted and simply amusing.",B
7828,Hope Springs Eternal,"A funny, occasionally poignant ""Fault in Our Stars"" send-up that's too short for its own good.",2.5/4
7829,Hopscotch,"Ronald Neame's cheeky spy comedy Hopscotch isn't quite an awful movie, but it's so thoroughly and relentlessly mediocre...",1.5/4

7831,Horns,... a smart distributor could make 'Horns' into a big win for all involved.,B-
7832,Horrible Bosses,"Like The Hangover, the genius of Horrible Bosses lies in the fact it takes the simplest of concepts and builds upon it with hilarious non-stop laughs.",8/10
7833,Horrible Bosses 2,"They feel like they are the bare minimum version of what could be very, very funny, and it frustrates me more than it makes me laugh.",C
7834,Horrid Henry: The Movie,"Over-indulgent children's comedy that's let down by a sloppy script, patchy direction and some poor performances, though it does have the occasional moment and its target audience will probably enjoy it.",2/5
7835,#Horror,A blunt satire of the dehumanization inherent in social media that also gets off on said detachment.,2/4
7836,Horror Express,"Pretty ghastly overall, some chills.",2/5
7837,Horror Hotel,"It may seem a somewhat trite and corny affair when compared with today's definition of 'horror movies,' but this one has the market cornered on atmosphere.",70/100
7838,Horror of Dracula,"He creates a count at once ominous and aristocratic, a demon who's scary and noble at the same time.... When Lee bares his fangs, he is the ultimate Count Dracula.",7/10
7839,Outside the Law (Hors-la-loi),A potentially inflammatory story about Muslim freedom-fighters/terrorists in France during the Algerian independence war gets the generic gangster-epic treatment.,2/4
7840,Horse Girl,"A dark movie that gets weird for no good reason, a victim of writers who can't figure out the ending to their story.",2/5
7841,The Horse Soldiers,This is a quintessential John Ford Western.,B
7842,The Horse Whisperer,"Though a bit overlong at nearly three hours and with a curiously unsatisfying ending, The Horse Whisperer nonetheless taps into the spirit of the characters and their noble mounts.",B
7843,Horsemen,"A grim picture, but utterly ridiculous; a film encouraged by its own sense of misery, though in service of a director who botches the delicate balance between procedural nightmares and familial concern.",D+
7844,The Horse's Mouth,Hard not to like,4/5
7845,Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!,"This is easily my favorite Seuss story (written in 1954, animated as a 30 minute TV special in 1970). New feature version enjoys great animation, but not so magical voicing.",2.5/4
7846,The Hospital,"Ham-handed satire, but effective with great lead performances.",4/5
7847,Hospitality,"Hospitality is as safe and static as a thriller can get. It's a movie that's more technically and performatively interesting than exciting, scary, or even all that good.",5.5/10
7848,Hostel,"...while there are few enjoyably over-the-top moments of gore, the movie is - on the whole - pretty tame...",2.5/4
7849,Hostel Part II,"Eli Roth has actually improved upon the first Hostel film, delivering a higher quotient of gore, but more importantly delivering an incredibly streamlined, and dare I say, mature spin on the slasher genre.",4/5
7850,Hostel: Part III,"Quick, fun, and blissfully brutal, it stands head and shoulders above the usual direct-to-video sequels that are shoved down our throats at a steady pace.",3.5/5
7851,Hostile,"There is a touching climax to the film ... a rarity in a movie that also features monstrosities roaming the desert like extras in The Descent, so worth sticking with for the duration.",7/10
7852,Hostile Border (Pocha: Manifest Destiny),"McLaughlin, for whom this is her first feature-length screenwriting credit, gives her characters incisive dialogue that keeps the human relations front and center.

7854,Hot Air,"The drama, set in the world of conservative talk radio, is the Left's latest broadside against the First Amendment.",1.5/4

7856,Hot Fuzz,Surely the funniest film you'll see this year.,9/10
7857,Hot Rod,"Silly at best, stupid at worst, and surprisingly unfunny overall, Hot Rod is a classic example of what's wrong with 'SNL.'",5/10
7858,Hot Shots! Part Deux,"The only trouble is, too many of these jokes (and there are hundreds) are throwaways.",2/5
7859,Hot Summer Nights,"Elijah Bynum's directorial debut, Hot Summer Nights, is a brazen anti-coming-of-age thriller that oozes with all the right confidence, chutzpah, and passion.",A-

7861,Hot Tub Time Machine,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but Hot Tub Time Machine is a smart comedy.",B+
7862,Hot Tub Time Machine 2,"With humor that makes Bill & Ted seem intelligent, this sequel is pretty much garbage. We had to wait five years for this?",3.5/10
7863,Hotel,A fundamentally insipid bid at experimental narrative.,1/5
7864,Hotel Artemis,"[Writer and director Drew Pearce] flaps around for a consistent tone, stunts some potential story lines and kicks out a bunch of cliches.",1/4
7865,Hotel de Love,"Hotel de Love is a pleasant and sometimes funny film, without being completely satisfying. It is too twee. Too many lines are said for their cuteness, too many exchanges sound like a comedy routine, and the movie works too earnestly at being daffy.",2.5/4
7866,Hotel for Dogs,"Oh yeah, there are some people in it, and they're perfectly OK. But it's not their movie.",3/5
7867,Hotel Mumbai,"The ensemble cast is excellent, with Patel giving a particularly moving performance. Empathy and emotions certainly run high in this two-hour nail-biter.",4/5
7868,The Hotel New Hampshire,So-so John Irving adaptation suffers from cinematic schizophrenia.,64/100

7871,Hotel Transylvania 2,"More focused, imaginative & tightly paced than the scattered, less thoughtful original, ""Hotel Transylvania 2"" is a merrily ghoulish excursion sure to please fans of the series while winning over those who wished the first film had tried a little harder.",2.5/4
7872,Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,"As is often the case, a lot of the freshness so abundant in the original is all but gone now from Hotel Transylvania 3: A Monster Vacation.",2.5/5

7876,Hour of the Gun,Rewritten history (Wyatt Earp) is somber offering,3/5
7877,Hour of the Wolf (Vargtimmen),"It may not be among Bergman's absolute best works, but that still makes it better than the best of most filmmakers.",4.5/5
7878,The Hours,This picture will be a major contributor to the award nomination scorecard on both sides of the gender aisle.,3/4
7879,Hours,"There's not a scene in Hours that doesn't feel slightly off, whether it's a bad choice of camera angle, awkwardly forced dialogue, or a plot twist that insults intelligence. Pardon the obvious cliché - it's not worth your time.",1.5/5
7880,House II: The Second Story,"A goofy, lightweight, paper-thin, schizophrenic mess.",2/5

7882,The House Bunny,What else can you say about a movie when Christopher McDonald counting to 30 is the funniest thing that happens in it?,1/4
7883,House By the River,Lang builds the film's routine melodrama into a snappy commentary on moral depravity and eye-for-an-eye retribution.,3/4
7884,House In The Alley,"Mr. Kiet, who wrote ""House in the Alley,"" needs a better script. And yet he shows promise.",2/5
7885,House of 1000 Corpses,"Dazzling visuals, gob smacking editing, flamboyant sets and deliciously over the top characters...I fail to see what the attraction is with this film",2/5
7886,House Of Boys,"While it feels somewhat dated, as well as melodramatic, the filmmaking is intimate enough to keep us engaged with the characters.",3.5/5
7887,House of Cardin,"He's simply a superb subject, paradoxically able to come across as humble but in no way modest: a master who knows he's a master, and knows we know it.",3/5

7892,Lisa And The Devil (Lisa e il diavolo) (The Devil in the House of Exorcism),"Boring, nonsensical horror flick.",2/5
7893,House of Flying Daggers,...a lot of the stuff started to feel a little too melodramatic and just didn't click for me.,5/10
7894,House of Fools,Comes awfully close to proving its point: that inmates in a psychiatric hospital are saner than the soldiers in the outside world.,B+
7895,House of Frankenstein,A wonderful Universal B-horror; the first of the all-star monster fests. Lots of fun with J. Carrol Naish almost stealing the show as the hunchback Daniel.,3/5
7896,House of Games,"There is a teasing quality to Mamet's presentations that reminds me of a skilled magician, meticulously laying out his cards while telling us a story.",4/4
7897,House of Hummingbird (Beolsae),"It is quite the depressing film, but it shows us that we as humans are masters of endurance.",7.5/10
7898,House of Pleasures,"Without soft-pedaling it-the story of ""The Girl Who Laughs"" alone will brush away that line of criticism-Bonello nonetheless mourns the extinction of the brothel, where the women at least had each other.",A-

7909,The House That Dripped Blood,"Cushing, Lee, and Pitt's dirty-pillows are memorable as always, but only the Lee section fully coheres",2.5/4
7910,Houseboat,This is a warm romantic comedy that is exceptionally perceptive and sensitive about the feelings of the children.,4/5
7911,Housebound,"Underneath its comical surface lies a story about responsibility, parenting and a troubling history of neglect. With Housebound Johnstone asks his audience not to look the other way in the most intriguing and riotous way possible.",4/5
7912,Houseguest,"A film that lacks solid construction from the ground up, something that can't be ""fixed in the editing,"" I'm afraid.",1/5
7913,Housesitter,"Housesitter is finally just a sweet and funny movie, rather than a comic masterpiece, but I think that's fine. It's what the movie wants to be.",3/4

7925,Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"Anthony Hopkins was chosen to narrate the film, perhaps to recall the English accent of Boris Karloff from the vastly superior original animation, a move the filmmakers should have avoided.",C
7926,How the West Was Won,The main problem remains the impossibility of subjecting a film that is fundamentally about landscape and history to the demands of such a coarse dramatic form.,2.5/5
7927,How to Be a Latin Lover,I like everyone connected with this movie so much that I am especially sorry to give it a bad review.,D
7928,How to Be a Player,"I watched the whole movie and am still not a ""player."" Therefore the film is a failure. Plus it's also pretty awful.",1.5/5

7932,How to Cook Your Life,Gentle preaching is still preaching.,2/4
7933,How to Deal,"Essentially The Virgin Suicides-lite, How to Deal unravels like pages from a self-flagellating tween girl's diary.",2/4

8122,The Ice Harvest,"Comedy director Harold Ramis achieves a showy, shadowy gang-who-couldn't -shoot-straight satire in a The Grifters cross with The Perfect Plan.",3.5/5
8123,Ice on Fire,"Ice on Fire may not be a great piece of cinema, but it serves its purpose well enough.",3/5
8124,The Ice Pirates,It'll really frost you,0/5
8125,Ice Princess,"It's not the most original of concepts I know, but Trachtenberg is so likable in the lead role, that you can't help but root for her.",3/4
8126,Ice Station Zebra,Excellent old-style political thriller.,4/5
8127,The Ice Storm,"[D]espite good performances and fine intentions, ultimately fails.",2/4
8128,Iceberg Slim: Portrait Of A Pimp,"If the subject interests you, buy and read a couple of Iceberg's books. This film is for entertainment only, although there is substantial entertainment to be had.",7/10
8129,Ichi the Killer (Koroshiya 1),Much of what we see is horrible but it's also undeniably exceedingly clever.,3.5/4
8130,Ida,"In a very short time, Pawlikowski's film tells us a powerful, poignant story with fine, intelligent performances from Kulesza and Trzebuchowska.",4/5
8131,Identity,What starts out as a seemingly-routine excursion into genre clichs emerges into a more complex and satisfying arena than most viewers will anticipate.,3.5/4
8132,Identity Thief,"It fails as a star vehicle, a recession-era satire, a WTF white-collar-grunt revenge tale, a Midnight Run-style buddy flick, a gross-out laughfest and a bathetic tale of broken souls.",2/5
8133,Idiocracy,"From start to finish this film is sharp, clever, and downright funny.",5/5
8134,Idiots and Angels,"Although this is, in part, a darkly comic exploration of man's inhumanity to man, there is a current of optimism, flowing like the artwork, beneath the story.",3.5/5
8135,Idiot's Delight,An unfulfilling adaptation of Robert E. Sherwood's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.,C
8136,Idle Hands,Excruciatingly unfunny!,2/4
8137,Idlewild,"Idlewild can't decide if it's about bullets, booze, broads or the sound of hip-hop that the film strenuously tries to marry to the 1930s.",2/4
8138,If....,A true British classic.,4/5
8139,If a Tree Falls: A Story of the Earth Liberation Front,It's a powerful tale; one guaranteed to generate heated discussions and with spirited debate solid box office often follows.,3/5
8140,If I Stay,A poignant portrait of a life precipitously hanging in the balance which pushes all the right buttons to open the emotional floodgates.,4/4
8141,"If I Want To Whistle, I Whistle",A stilted and frustrating grab-bag of stylistic and narrative clichs propping up nothing at all in particular.,5/10
8142,If I Were You,"Acaba levando o espectador a desejar trocar de corpo com alguém que, preferencialmente, esteja bem longe da sala de projeção.",2/5
8143,If Lucy Fell,"A disappointingly superficial romantic comedy. There's no chemistry between any of the characters. The acting is mediocre, with Schaeffer and Parker exhibiting no screen presence.",2/4
8144,If the Dancer Dances,"It's less of an insightful backstage documentary than a gushing, sycophantic love letter to the late Merce Cunningham.",2/4
8145,If You Build It,"If You Build It works successfully as a human interest story, albeit one with a bittersweet ending that condemns the stingy, misguided minds running at least one of our country's school boards...",3.5/5
8146,"If You Don't, I Will",One to watch and laugh ruefully at with your partner if you're in a pretty secure place-those on the skids should not apply.,B
8147,Igby Goes Down,Unusually well-grounded in terms of its offbeat characters and ironic situations.,3.5/5
8148,Ikiru,I think this is one of the few movies that might actually be able to inspire someone to lead their life a little differently.,4/4
8149,Il Divo,"Witty, playful, poignant, and boasting a charismatic turn from Servillo, Sorrentino's chronicle of notorious Italian politico Andreotti is deservedly a highlight of the 2008 Cannes Film Festival; it's time to release all of Sorrentino's work in the U.S.",A-
8150,Il Futuro,"Hauer, absolutely superb, exudes sadness and longing as a hulking, damaged man grasping at the past.",4/5
8151,I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer,I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer is entirely worthy of the dismissive derision that you felt when you first read the title.,1.5/5
8152,I'll Be There,An ill-advised vanity project that will do little to salvage its star's sullied reputation.,2/5
8153,I'll Do Anything,"It is helpful, I think, to simply forget about the missing songs, and recognize that I'll Do Anything is a complete movie without them -- smart, original, subversive.",3/4
8154,I'll Follow You Down,"Ambitious but clunky, ""I'll Follow You Down"" is not quite the picture to be Haley Joel Osment's post-adolescent breakthrough, but it is a step in the right direction.",2/4
8155,I'll See You in My Dreams,"This is the mercurial nature of cinema. With good casting, decent writing and a light directorial touch where others might go for full-frontal schmaltz, almost any scenario can win you over.",3/5
8156,I'll See You In My Dreams,Overly sentimental.,C+
8157,I'll Sleep When I'm Dead,"I don't ordinarily mind super-slow revenge tales, so long as the actual revenge part at the end makes up for it...and here it doesn't.",4/10
8158,I'll Take You There,I merely went along for the bumpy ride.,C-
8159,I'll Take Your Dead,"The life-like thriller, eccentric comedy, and outlandish horror elements don't quite gel as well as intended, clumsily getting in each other's way.",6/10
8160,Illegal,A well-crafted and realistic look at the shameful and humiliating treatment of illegal immigrants in Belgian detention centers.,4/5
8161,Illegal Tender,"A problematic but compelling exaltation of violence, privilege, and ethnic pride, Illegal Tender is incessantly but hotly scored, suggesting something of a Sirk melodrama for our Reggaeton times.",2.5/4
8162,Illtown,Will leave viewers grasping for a meaning.,2.5/4
8163,Illuminata,Turturro overdirects his players with an athletic intensity.,2.5/4
8164,The Illusionist,"It's a marginal story, and passionless in the way it's been antiseptically brought to the screen, but it's not unenjoyable.",C+
8165,The Illustrated Man,Interesting if not totally successful adaptation of Bradbury's stories.,4/5
8166,Ilo Ilo,"A film that is both a vivid portrait of recession-struck Singapore in 1997 and a subdued, bittersweet affair that retains a natural feel.",4/5
8167,Happily Ever After,"Anyone who watches Yvan Attal's breezy, skin-deep sex comedy can identify with the grass-is-always-greener daydreams that haunt its characters.",3/5
8168,Ilya and Emilia Kabakov: Enter Here,"The research that went into the film seems a largesse, but it's compromised at every turn by filmmaker Amei Wallach's sloppy, pedantic delivery.",0.5/4
8169,I'm All Right Jack,Splendid Boulting Brothers satire with a great Peter Sellers performance.,5/5
8170,I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can,I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can hasn't exactly aged all that well. And that's me being kind.,2/5
8171,I'm Gonna Git You Sucka,A tribute to blaxploitation phenomenon.,6/10
8172,I'm In Love With A Church Girl,A message film with the narrative sophistication of a recruiting pamphlet.,1/5
8173,I'm Losing You,A few flaws in his script keep the film from being a complete success.,2.5/4
8174,I'm Not Ashamed,Ultimately it's just another vehicle for a series of scenes in which devout characters remind each other that God has it all under control.,D+
8175,I'm Not Rappaport,"The beauty of the language does come through, but the net effect of the movie is to make the viewers wish they had gone to the play instead.",2.5/4
8176,I'm Not There,"Incorporates and represents everything I hate about Bob Dylan, which is what everyone loves about Bob Dylan, so this is emphatically a movie for those who worship the man.",D+
8177,I'm So Excited!,"A camp, frothy piece of fun, arguably indulgent and occasionally misjudged in its casual depictions of sex, but ultimately won out by Almodvar's incessant love of tall stories.",3/5
8178,I'm Still Here,"Increasingly annoying, deluded, mumbling narcissism. Joaquin Phoenix may still be here, somewhere, but I no longer care.",2/5
8179,I'm Through with White Girls (The Inevitable Undoing of Jay Brooks),"Alternately entertaining and enlightening, this hilariously funny flick is proof positive that it's possible to shoot a sophisticated romantic romp on a shoe-string budget.",4/4
8180,Images,"A challenging film, heavy on symbolism and motifs.",B
8181,Imaginary Crimes,"The obvious points of the movie are made quickly: That Ray is a liar and a con man, and his daughters are being raised in a world of self-deception and uncertainty. The deeper points emerge more slowly.",3.5/4
8182,Blush (Imaginary Order),"As suburban supermom meltdowns go... ""Imaginary Order"" goes deep, thanks to some smart and scary twists and a compelling performance by Wendi McLendon-Covey.",3/4
8183,Imagine: John Lennon,"The result is the portrait of a man who was complex, sometimes confused, not always very happy, but a great artist all the same.",3/4
8184,Imagine Me & You,...this is the sort of movie that's almost impossible to all-out dislike (provided one approaches it with the appropriate mindset).,2.5/4
8185,Imagining Argentina,"It's maddening that the film is so weak, because there's a touching and seriously important story here that should have been told with power, honesty and humanity.",1.5/5
8186,Africa: The Serengeti,"While Africa is completely absorbing, it's best viewed as a primer to the subject matter. With its 40-minute run time, viewers are able to grasp only a surface understanding of the material.",3/4
8187,Cirque du Soleil: Journey of Man,Pleasant.,2/4
8188,Imitation Girl,"Beautifully filmed, thoughtful and dreamlike, Imitation Girl is an impressive piece of work.",4/5
8189,The Immaculate Conception of Little Dizzle,"Looking as if it were devised on acid and executed on mushrooms, this imaginative debut feature from the Seattle artist and filmmaker David Russo finds meaning in cleaning and life in dead ends.",3.5/5
8190,Immediate Family,"I cared for all of the characters, I was moved by the writing and acting of some of the key scenes, and yet the movie as a whole failed to really reach me.",2/4
8191,Immigration Tango,The movie never comes close to making you believe such an arrangement between these people could ever exist.,1/4
8192,Immoral Tales,"Quaint, ponderous, pretentious and perverse",1.5/4
8193,Immortal,"""Immortal"" is inventive and engaging, with more emotionality and surprise than similar offerings.",B+
8194,Immortal Beloved,"Despite its Citizen Kane structure, Immortal Beloved is a Hollywood biopic of a very traditional kind, and not a single cliche of the genre is neglected.",2.5/5
8195,Immortality,Not much actually happens.,2.5/5
8196,Immortals,Immortals is worth seeing just for the battle prowess of Zeus and his cronies.,3.5/5
8197,Imperial Dreams,"Imperial Dreams bucks the usual ""ghetto drama"" trend in its depiction of a father who refuses to fall back into the street life.",4/5
8198,Imperium,Daniel Radcliffe as never before seen infiltrates the weirdos in the American Nazi movement.,B+
8199,The Importance of Being Earnest,Parker pushes a bit -- who knew Earnest had a love duet sung by Algy and Jack? -- but he proves this vintage bubbly hasn't lost its fizz.,3.5/5
8200,Impossible Monsters,An interesting idea for this thriller-horror is frustrated by poor performances and an unintelligent script.,4/10
8201,Impostor,Feels like one of those sci-fi TV shows that you watch for an hour and then forget all about.,5/10
8202,Impractical Jokers: The Movie,"If you're already a fan of the Impractical Jokers, you'll probably like the movie. If not, you might not get it and there's just no real use trying.",6.5/10
8203,Imprisoned,"Slow, dramatically flat and utterly generic Puerto Rican prison melodrama",1.5/4
8204,Impromptu,"As a salon full of characters, Impromptu provides great fly on the wall fun.",3/5
8205,In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale,"A major piece of crap. It shamelessly steals from J.R.R. Tolkien/Peter Jackson, but with none of the intelligence, heart and artistry.",0.5/4
8206,In A Better World,"Denmark's Oscar entry is a poignant, provocative film about masculinity, parents' responsility and the dangers of violence in everyday life.",B+
8207,In a Lonely Place,"Superb film noir, brilliantly directed by the gifted Ray with Bogart as a talented but volatile Hollywood screenwriter.",5/5
8208,In a Relationship,"In its own fun and flimsy way, Boyd's film acutely traces the moment when a person learns that our stories only become true by sharing them with somebody else.",B
8209,In a Valley of Violence,"In A Valley Of Violence is a thrilling tale of Western revenge with rawhide grit, finding constant, and surprising enjoyment in gallows humor.",8/10
8210,In a World...,"Bell's film wants to tell the tale of Hollywood and its vocally-gifted minions picking up the mantle for a new era, but shockingly buries its own lead until it practically becomes an ironic parody of itself.",2/4
8211,In America,"For much of the movie, mundane, authentic details are ignored, which stretches credibility.",3/5
8212,In & Out,"A truly funny, sophisticated, compassionate, mainstream Hollywood comedy about very modern homosexuality.",A-
8213,In Another Country,"It almost seems as if Hong is poking fun at his own single-minded oeuvre, creating a fractal representation of how his other films obliquely interrelate.",C+
8214,In Between Days,"The camera lingers on the characters' minimal, but expressive actions, allowing the viewer to soak in their emotions rather than having them related to us through dialogue. In Between Days is more of an experience than your average movie.",4/5
8215,In Bruges,"If In Bruges doesn't end up being the funniest and most quotable movies of the year, then it should be very close.",9/10
8216,In Country,"The movie is like a time bomb. You sit there, interested, absorbed, sometimes amused, sometimes moved, but wondering in the back of your mind what all of this is going to add up to. Then you find out.",3/4
8217,In Darkness,A harrowing story of a Polish Catholic who develops empathy for the Jews he saved during WWII.,B+
8218,In Darkness,Anthony Bryne's high-flown style only serves to highlight the film's icky way of exploiting real-world tragedy for kicks.,2/4
8219,In Dreams,This routine fright factory employs the usual horror movie tactics.,2/4
8220,In Dubious Battle,"""In Dubious Battle"" marks an embrace of a kind of anonymous, fuddy-duddy traditionalist approach. In short, it's maybe James Franco's best-crafted film to date, and also maybe his dullest.",C
8221,In Fabric,"The source may be different for everyone, but the thrill is always the same. ""In Fabric"" doesn't know what you want, but Peter Strickland is certain that it will drive you wild.",B+
8222,In Fear,Lovering has crafted an old-fashioned thriller for those who like to be gripped without gore and which offers enough surprise and inventiveness to suggest that he has a career beckoning beyond the confines of television.,3/5
8223,In God's Hands,Put simply: wipe-out!,1/5
8224,In Good Company,You won't see anything else more cleverly produced this year.,4/5
8225,In Harm's Way,Preminger seems happier with long transition shots of the Hawaiian Islands and military class ships than it does with creating rhythm in the film's narrative.,61/100
8226,In Her Shoes,"You'll probably need a tissue or two, but the film earns every sniffle due to its sharply astute writing, directing and acting.",4/5
8227,In Like Flint,"A clumsy, bland and far too subtle satire of the spy genre.",59/100
8228,In My Country,"A direo de Boorman e o roteiro deixam muito a desejar, muitas vezes apostando num maniquesmo desnecessrio. Porm, o filme tem corao e alma - e isto faz a diferena.",3/5
8229,In My Father's House,"Che's mission to lift his father up. . .intimately demonstrates [how] health care, education and supportive housing. . .help a motivated man gain confidence and his life.",7/10
8230,In My Sleep,"Spectacularly witless, In My Sleep is another depressing reminder of what happens when you give cameras to jocks.",1.5/4
8231,In Old Arizona,"If it appears that I'm being too hard on this film, one doesn't have to look very far to see far superior films, both sound and silent, released around the same time.",1.5/5
8232,In Old Chicago,"Like San Francisco, events sort of just happen and allegiances just sort of shift around to stall time before the grand finale.",2/4
8233,In Our Nature,"""In Our Nature"" is as prophetic as it is provocative, exploring dysfunction, in a recognizable but no less satisfying way.",B
8234,In Search of Beethoven,A thoroughly researched and engagingly presented portrait of the composer.,3.5/5
8235,In Search of Blind Joe Death: The Saga of John Fahey,"If you didn't already admire his music, you may be searching for more of it after seeing this documentary.",3/5
8236,In Search Of Chopin,"It's one of Grabsky's best films, using his well-established formula of readings from letters and diaries, talking-head appearances by musicians and other authorities, and an abundance of well-chosen musical excerpts, linked by [his] sensitive narration.",4/5
8237,In Search of Greatness,"Insightful sports docu connects passion, play to genius.",4/5
8238,In Search of Haydn,This is a film that sweeps away preconceptions with a very thorough broom.,3/5
8239,In Search of Memory (Auf der Suche nach dem Gedächtnis),"No negatives can detract from the warm, inviting, slightly-yellowed smile of this survivor and optimist with more to teach us than just neuroscience.",3/5
8240,In Search of Mozart,"No more important, or more beautifully filmed, documentary about Mozart's life and music has emerged from the Mozart Year 2006 than writer-director Phil Grabsky's In Search of Mozart.",4/4
8241,In Secret,"Filmmaker Charlie Stratton takes a rather obvious approach to Emile Zola's iconic 1867 novel Therese Raquin, ramping up the melodrama while drenching everything in shadowy doom and gloom.",3/5
8242,In the Aisles (In den Gängen),In the Aisles is a poignant and richly sympathetic film.,4/5
8243,In the Army Now,"For the uninitiated, Shore's screen persona is somewhere between Jim Varney and Jim Carrey -- if you drained them of all their energy and personality.",1.5/4
8244,In the Bedroom,"an amazingly deft debut for actor-turned-director Todd Field, who has obviously been watching the great directors he's had a chance to work with",4/4
8245,In the Blood,Carano's newlywed with a dark past ‒ think Jeanne Moreau in 'The Bride Wore Black' meets Michelle Yeoh -- kicks some serious butt ... One of the best payback thrillers since 'Death Wish' and 'First Blood.',4/4
8246,In the Company of Men,"It's an impressive film, and all the more so for being a debut feature. If this LaBute guy can keep his edge on a bigger budget, he's one to watch.",B+
8247,In The Courtyard,Salvadori explores themes and layers of the genre that are very uncommon. [Full review in Spanish],3.5/5
8248,In the Cut,Challenging and bracing ... and somewhat wearying! But the film emerges triumphant due to sensitive performances from Ryan and Ruffalo.,4/5
8249,In the Electric Mist,There are too many subplots going on to make it work other than as a mildly intriguing curiosity.,2/5
8250,In the Fade (Aus dem Nichts),"In The Fade is not subtle, a revenge procedural in its way, playing easy political cards - but it is urgent, gripping and, today, so very affecting.",4/5
8251,In the Family,"Mr. Wang's slow-reveal psychological drama isn't just a showcase for his excellent ensemble cast. Beautifully modulated and stylistically sui generis, ""In the Family"" is also one of the most accomplished and undersold directorial debuts this year.",4.5/5
8252,In the Good Old Summertime,Charming musical with wonderful Judy Garland,4/5
8253,In the Heart of the Sea,"After two dreary hours of this, In the Heart of the Sea finally hits dry land and collapses in a state of complete exhaustion.",2/5
8254,In the Heat of the Night,How fine a film this is.,9/10
8255,In the Intense Now (No Intenso Agora),"Although João Moreira Salles tries to tap into the pleasurable elements inherent to the essayistic as a cinematic form, such as making the merging of intimate and social reality poetically visible, his storylines never quite gel.",1.5/4
8256,In the Land of Blood and Honey,"After a while, Jolie's catalogue of horrors begins to feel less like a necessary addition to an underconsulted historical record and more like a numbing assault on the viewer.",1.5/4
8257,In the Land of Women,"Kasdan fils makes a feature debut as writer-helmer of a coming of age saga that recalls The Graduate, positing a confused youngster between an ailing mom and rebellious daughter, sans the nasty tone of that satire; Adam Brody and Meg Ryan are terrific.",B
8258,In the Line of Fire,"Though the movie is engrossing, it lacks something: fire, weirdness, originality.",B
8259,In the Loop,"It's a stroke of genius to play a tense political thriller as if it's a raucous satire. Slicing straight through any over-seriousness, this film keeps us laughing loudly as it tells a story that's probably far truer than we'd like to believe.",4.5/5
8260,In the Mirror of Maya Deren,A monument to an important and overlooked artist.,3/4
8261,In the Mix,we can hope that the steady march of progress will render this movie entirely worthless in the not-too-distant future.,1/5
8262,In the Mouth of Madness,"Cheesy horror celebrating the power of cheesy horror, while pretending to be appalled.",1/4
8263,In the Name of My Daughter,"Haenel and Deneuve, puffing on cigarettes at every turn, aren't given enough material to make their characters identifiable as human beings worth empathizing over; their bourgeois, petty squabbles over money increasingly difficult to care about.",C-
8264,In the Name of the Father,"It is an injection into a society at war, Northern Ireland and England in the Seventies and a compelling account of a son and father making their peace.",4.5/5
8265,In the Pit,"After 45 minutes of seeing this hard work, we get the point.",2/5
8266,In the Realm of the Senses,The sex doesn't seem to be gratuitous.,A

8269,In the Tall Grass,In the Tall Grass doesn't end as tall as it begins.,C+
8270,In the Valley of Elah,"Haggis, with an exemplary cast, explores shadowy secrets of men in the ranks with a determined brush, tipped with heart-piercing irony.",4.5/5
8271,In Their Skin,"Winds up turning itself into just a rote thriller about psychos learning that, appearance notwithstanding, every family has dysfunctional problems.",2/4
8272,In Time,Falls apart whenever there's a lull in the action and you start to think about how it all fits together.,2.5/5
8273,In un altro paese,Marco Turco's absorbing and gut-wrenching look on the Sicilian Mafia and the Italian government's attempts to crush it is essential viewing for anyone interested in recent Italian history.,3/5
8274,In Which We Serve,"Sentimental, to be sure, and a tad too stiff-upper-lipped at times, but it is a moving portrait of a navy destroyer, the men who served on it.",3.5/5
8275,In Your Eyes,"It's not a rousing success, but as a lightweight sketch drawn out to uneven feature-length, it manages to deliver a minor entry in the Whedon canon by keeping its most insightful character-driven ingredients intact.",B
8276,InAPPropriate Comedy,"An inept, brutally unfunny collection of sketches ...",0/4
8277,Inbred,Beginning with an Emily Booth cameo and heading swiftly downhill from there ...,1/5

8279,Incendiary,"Williams is magnificent in her role -- though they beat the living hell out of her, to a point where it almost becomes ridiculous.",3/5
8280,Incendies,"Villeneuve's control over the material, Andr Turpin's vivid cinematography, and committed performances make this modern-day Greek tragedy feel timeless.",4/5
8281,Inception,A wildly entertaining and dazzling mind-trip not to be missed. Kubrick would have been proud.,5/5
8282,Inch'Allah,"However beautiful, a blank slate is, finally, just that.",2.5/5
8283,Incident at Oglala,"Incident at Oglala is about his specific case, but in a sense it is about a larger subject, about the continuing insult of a federal government which treats and regards Native Americans in a paternalistic, repressive style.",3/4
8284,Incident at Loch Ness,"Possibly the bravest, most daring and original cinematic experience of the year.",A
8285,Incident In a Ghost Land (Ghostland),"Misogynistic, transphobic and persistently mean-spirited, Ghostland is an exhausting and unrewarding watch.",2/5
8286,Incognito,Pretty good thriller actually.,4/5
8287,Inconceivable,"Uneven, violent throwback thriller has iffy messages.",2/5
8288,An Inconvenient Truth,Subtext is just as important as text in Al Gore's cautionary tale of global warming and call to arms. Docu shows how personal tragedies (Gore almost losing his son) and crises can be channeled creatively toward relevant issues larger than oneself.,4/5
8289,The Incredible Hulk Returns,"Speaks volumes about the inevitability of the metamorphosis of hippie to yuppie, as well as the death of a dream that that transformation encompasses.",2/4

8291,The Incredible Shrinking Man,"The special effects and trick photography are cleverly done (for its time). Also, the story is intelligently handled.",3.5/4
8292,The Incredibles,"The Incredibles may fight to save the world, but they teach us to know thyself.",3/4
8293,Incredibles 2,"Incredibles 2 feels a bit late to the game, but will still delight audiences in the themes and family togetherness it promotes.",6.5/10
8294,Indecent Proposal,"It is artificial and manipulative, and in the real world this sort of thing would never happen in this way, but then that's why we line up at the ticket window: We want to leave the real world, for a couple of hours, anyway.",3/4
8295,Independence Day: Resurgence,"In trying to recapture the sheer entertainment value of the first movie, Independence Day: Resurgence forgot it was making a movie for modern audiences, relying on the kind of bad dialogue and plot contrivances better left in the 20th century.",2/5
8296,India - Kingdom of the Tiger,"This docudrama has a nice mix of the history of conservation, a travelogue of India that showcases the varied landscapes and magnificent architecture, and footage of tigers in the wild.",3.5/5
8297,The Indian in the Cupboard,"By making the fantasy real, the movie unleashes all sorts of considerations it doesn't really deal with, and the material edges closer to horror than it probably intends.",2/4
8298,Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"At its best, sublime. Overall, the great moments make up for the mediocre.",4/5
8299,Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"As I watched it, I felt a real delight, because recent Hollywood escapist movies have become too jaded and cynical, and they have lost the feeling that you can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop.",3.5/4
8300,Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"From our perspective it is still a very good piece of Hollywood entertainment, much superior to the more recent examples of same genre.",7/10

8302,Indignation,"Unfortunately, on the whole, Schamus' debut feels too self-serious to fully engage.",3/5
8303,Indigo Children,"Elliptical, lyrical and provocative film and filled with visual poetry. It defies genre while remaining unpredictable and refreshingly un-Hollywood.",8.2/10
8304,Indiscretion of an American Wife (Stazione Termini),I'd be hard-pressed to name two actors with less obvious chemistry together.,2.5/5
8305,Indivisible,Homecoming from war treated as more than merely tying a yellow ribbon around an old oak tree and leaving the rest to Jesus.,3.5/4

8307,Inequality For All,"It's still the CEOs' fault, but this movie holds them accountable for specific actions going back to the '70s, so that gives us a lot more to make sense of than just abstract blame.",8/10

8309,Infamous,The film stretches plausibility.,2.5/5
8310,Infamous,"In the current world where many young people are using their voice for positive change, Infamous seems a damming portrayal of a generation that actually cares about more than followers and likes.",2/5
8311,Clandestine Childhood,"Benjamn vila structures the film as a series of precious moments, remembrances of a difficult year when the politics of patria and family got in the way of his puppy love.",2/4

8315,Inferno,"Having already taken two rides on the Dan Brown merry-go-round, shouldn't this have been the one where Ron finally got it right?",3/5
8316,Infini,A tense little sci-fi mystery with plenty to muse on,3/5
8317,Infinitely Polar Bear,"Forbes has a delicate but unsentimental approach, which gives her film the same infectious energy that blesses and curses Cameron. The end result feels good without feeling superficial.",4/5

8330,The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,"Mark Robson's loose adaptation of a British missionary's tale is well intentioned and well acted by Ingrod Bergman, but suffers from the casting of the Asian roles with actors like Robert Donat or Curt Jurgens.",B-

8332,Innerspace,"Fun is to be had, but not too memorable in retrospect.",3/4
8333,Innocence,Whatever allegorical potential existed in Mendelsohn's novel is lost in favor of generic teenage petulance and worn-out horror-movie devices.,2/5
8334,Innocent Blood,"It loses steam and coherence about midway through, leaving us rooting for it but doomed to disappointment.",2.5/5
8335,An Innocent Man,"An Innocent Man has all the elements to put us through an emotional wringer, but the movie never works up any enthusiasm for them. It's the most relaxed crime movie of the year.",1.5/4

8346,Inside Man,"Lee, like Croneberg (History of Violence), has taken a familiar genre-the heist/perfect crime-and injected into it new elements and his authorial vision, resulting his best film in a decade.",B+
8347,Inside Out,"Yes, this is heady stuff, which is apt since the film takes place in a young girl's head. Inside Out is tremendous, an instant animation classic that's a far cry from being kids stuff. This is Pixar growing up, and it's all the better for it.",A-
8348,Inside Out,"Lawyer-turned-screenwriter Dylan Schaffer's script is an unhappy combination of genres, tones, too many dead stretches of people in cars and inept dialogue.",1/4

8370,The Interpreter,They really don't make 'em like this anymore: tightly wound thrillers with a political relevance that adds newsworthy urgency to the drama and suspense.,4/5
8371,Intersection,The concept sounds reasonable until the characters start reciting some truly dumb dialogue.,2/4
8372,Interstellar,"Nolan's aesthetically beautiful, large-scale sci-fi drama is admirable in its ideas and style, but lacking in its storytelling and execution.",2.5/5
8373,Interview with the Assassin,May reawaken discussion of the Kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen.,2/4

8385,Into The Forest,"Into The Forest is admirably defiant of many tropes that spring up in most apocalyptic stories, emphasizing its small character moments over large dramatic ones.",4.5/5
8386,Into the Inferno,The footage Herzog's compiled coalesces into a truly cinematic experience.,B+
8387,Into the Night,"A little bit of Into the Night is funny, a lot of it is grotesque and all of it has the insidey manner of a movie made not for the rest of us but for moviemakers on the Bel Air circuit who watch each other's films in their own screening rooms.",1.5/5
8388,Into The Storm,"A junk-food thriller with skillfully believable special effects and a lurchingly ham-fisted script, one that commands attention and spurs resulting groans in equal measure.",2/4
8389,Into the White,"Although nicely produced, this second world war yarn is bland and predictable.",2/5

8391,Into the Woods,"The first two-thirds of the film, which are like the Brothers Grimm's Greatest Hits on laughing gas, have a fizzy, fairy-dust energy.",B-
8392,Intolerable Cruelty,"With a giddy, chin-up, straight-face delivery, the film is deadpan silly.",3/4
8393,Intrigo: Dear Agnes,"The second in a trilogy of murder mysteries based on novels by Swedish author Hakan Nesser, this one, like the others, suffers from chilliness of character and pacing; it never quite clicks.",2/5
8394,Intrigo: Death of an Author,The film evinces neither the visceral pleasures of noir nor the precision to uncover deeper thematic resonances.,1.5/4
8395,Introducing the Dwights,"New title (at Sundance it was called Clubland) better suggests the central issue, the difficulties of living in attention-craving showbiz family, but the tone of the familiar coming-of-age saga is not right.",C+

8397,Intruders,What begins as a masterfully crafted creature feature ultimately falls flat on its face knocking out all of its teeth.,2.5/5
8398,Intruders,"As far as indie genre films go, Shut In is a great reminder that you can take a familiar idea and still find new ways to surprise viewers when you infuse your story with a few inventive swerves. Riesgraf's performance is nothing short of amazing.",4/5
8399,Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus,"The sci-fi elements are fun, the humor is wildly absurd, and the animation is breathtaking. In this case, that's enough for this return to be worth the wait.",7.5/10

8403,Inventing the Abbotts,Would be a lot more fun were it a trashy Troy Donahue-Diane McBain vehicle ground out by Warner Bros. in 1960.,1.5/4
8404,The Invention of Lying,An okay film with a funny premise that offers enough laughs to excuse the weaker direction.,7/10
8405,Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion,A provocative political thriller that is as troubling today as when it came out in 1970. Maybe more so.,4.5/5
8406,Invictus,"Seasoned vet that he is, Eastwood simplifies things with one hand and milks them with the other. Much the way Nelson Mandela, for the sake of his country, made sure he squeezed every drop of inspiration he could out of the Springboks.",3/5

8431,The Iron Mask,"Fairbanks was getting old, but still offers his trademark dash and flamboyance; one of the last great silent films.",3/5
8432,Iron Sky,"It's not terrible, by any means: just not nearly as funny or cruel as its killer premise suggests.",2/5
8433,Iron Sky: The Coming Race,"... there's something so refreshing, so pure, about the Iron Sky series in what it attempts, that audiences can't help but get swept up in its wake.",4/5

8499,I've Got Issues,Be forewarned. This is not an easy watch. It can be a little to random and sketch films inevitably have some weaker segments But the best parts will make you laugh out loud.,6/10
8500,I've Loved You So Long,Credible tale of the impact on her family and others of a woman who killed her child.,B
8501,Ivory Tower,The documentary is more interested in covering all its bases than making sure it fully has its foot on each base.,2.5/4

8510,Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer,"Hardly the re-invention of the genre wheel, but that's fine by me. It's just a whole bunch of sick, sly, silly fun.",4/5

8515,Jack of the Red Hearts,"Grillo is one of the few filmmakers out there who possesses an understanding of autism and the drain of personal care, and she once again uses this knowledge to deepen material, giving it a perspective few productions dare to offer.",B+

8519,Jack the Giant Killer,"In spite of its obvious flaws (inferior animations), Jack the Giant Killer is movie magic that's rife with rich fantasy and winsome playfulness.",B
8520,Jack the Giant Slayer,"Marked by simple narrative and often silly dialogue, Singer's fantasy adventure offers the basic thrills (but no more) expected by fans of this subgenre.",C+
8521,The Jackal,"The Jackal is a glum, curiously flat thriller about a man who goes to a great deal of trouble in order to create a crime that anyone in the audience could commit more quickly and efficiently.",1.5/4

8526,Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa,Johnny Knoxville dons latex to play a wildly inappropriate grandfather in a Borat-style feature film. Guilty sniggers follow.,3/5
8527,Jackass - The Movie,"For fans of MTV's now defunct ""Jackass"" series, the best thing that can be said about Jackass: The Movie is that it offers more of the same but with an NC-17 twist.",2/4

8535,The Jackie Robinson Story,Lackluster production but great central baseball hero.,2/5
8536,Jacknife,"Jacknife redeems it in the specifics of the performances. De Niro, Harris and Baker seem to be oblivious to the ""message,"" and lose themselves in the personalities of their characters. And so the movie works.",3/4

8546,Jake Speed,"There's something magical going on in Jake Speed, something that transcends the B-movie action and the occasionally clumsy moments.",4/5
8547,Jake Squared,For a film that wants desperately to wring comedy from the narcissism and neuroses of Hollywood filmmakers it's neither funny or particularly insightful.,1/5
8548,Jakob the Liar,"As noble an effort this is, released a week after Yom Kippur, the Jewish day of atonement, it will only receive second-class accommodations from the movie-going public.",2/4

8550,James and the Giant Peach,"This movie may not make headlines among all of the adults, but I predict it will among the kids.",3/4
8551,James VS His Future Self,A frequently witty and spirited work that benefits immeasurably from that dynamite turn from Daniel Stern.,4
8552,James White,"Other actors would have milked the dramatic opportunities here for all they were worth, but Nixon and Abbott - the latter glimpsed briefly in A Most Violent Year - keep their sights on the heartbreaking inevitability of the situation.",4/5
8553,Jamesy Boy,"Burns has overcome a lot of hardship in his life, and his story is truly inspiring, but not everybody's story needs to be a movie.",2.5/5
8554,Jamie Marks Is Dead,"It is rare for a film to be creepy, sexy and deeply moving, all at the same time. Filmmaker Carter Smith walks an impressive high wire act. (Interview with Smith included.)",B+
8555,Jandek on Corwood,"The film's a puckish, if overlong, essay on the hipness of enigma.",3/4
8556,Jane Austen's Emma,The acting and writing with this outing make it much more palatable. [Kate] Beckinsale manages to make her Emma a very likable-albeit selfish and spiteful-heroine who obviously needs to do some growing up.,3.5/5
8557,Jane Eyre,"The acting of the two leads, Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska, is the best element of this stark, spare, sporadically involving version of Bronte's classic novel.",B-
8558,Jane Got a Gun,"Jane Got a Gun manages to tell a modest - you might say highly inconsequential - yarn that's not even lightly spiced with ideas, circumspection, interesting characters or basic logic. It's a film that just... happens.",1/5
8559,Jane Wants a Boyfriend,"""Jane Wants a Boyfriend"" loses momentum careening between Dushku's Bianca and Krause's Jane - the latter of whom is far more interesting.",2/4
8560,Jane White is Sick and Twisted,Jane White is Sick and Twisted is never going to be mistaken for an Oscar Winner or Merchant-Ivory production. I mean that as a compliment.,3.5/5

8562,Janie Jones,"...a watchable, sporadically moving drama...",2.5/4
8563,Janis: Little Girl Blue,"It's only 92 minutes long, but it draws the audience into a magisterial biography; it's electric, intimate and heartbreaking.",5/5
8564,Jannat 2,It never lives up to the cheeky-rogue promise of its first scenes.,2.5/5
8565,The January Man,"It wants to be zany but violent, satirical but slapstick, romantic but cynical. It wants some of its actors to rant and rave like amateur tragedians, and others to reach for subtle nuances. And it wants all of these things to happen at the same time.",1/4
8566,Japanese Story,"Japanese Story is a good film -- a memorable, provocative and emotional one.",3.5/5
8567,Japon,The breadth and depth of Japon belies its standing as a directorial debut.,4.5/5
8568,Jason Becker: Not Dead Yet,"Jesse Vile's moving documentary can't go wrong with such an inspiring, funny and genuinely nice guy taking the spotlight he deserves.",4/5
8569,Jason Bourne,"To revitalize the franchise, they should knock Bourne upside the head and disappear his memory again. The true fun of 'Bourne' is seeing it all coming back to him, while doing cool stuff.",3/5
8570,Jason Goes to Hell - The Final Friday,"That the end result is convoluted, lacking in logical coherence, and sometimes downright silly is not ideal, but you can sense the genuine desire to take the story in a new direction",2/4
8571,Jason X,"In the annals of the Friday the 13th series, Jason X is one of the weaker entries.",1.5/4
8572,Jason's Lyric,"It's not some little plot-bound genre formula. It's invigorating, how much confidence it has, and how much space it allows itself.",3/4

8576,Jaws,"...a classic, action-adventure monster movie, maybe the best ever made. (Blu-ray edition)",10/10
8577,Jaws 2,the filmmakers did everything they could to breathe new life into the material without forgetting what had made that material work in the first place,3/4
8578,Jaws 3,"The shark gets more time on screen than before only it's not a wise decision, as it remarkably looks cheaper than in the last film.",2/5
8579,Jaws: The Revenge,"The shark models have so little movement that at times they seem to be supporting themselves on boats, instead of attacking them. Up until the ludicrous final sequence of the movie, the scariest creature in the film is an eel.",0/4
8580,Jay & Silent Bob Reboot,"A successful return to form for Kevin Smith... It may be his raunchiest film in years, but it's also his most emotionally intelligent.",7/10
8581,Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back,A road/chase comedy that wants nothing more than to make the audience laugh--and are there ever laughs to be had.,3.5/4
8582,Jayne Mansfield's Car,"A triumphant return to directing for Billy Bob Thornton. It's maybe not as monumental as Sling Blade, but it's a fine piece of character work with an unmistakable Thornton touch.",7/10
8583,Jazz on a Summer's Day,As generous a dish of top jazz music as any cat could take in one gulp.,4/5
8584,JCVD (Van Dammage),...is never quite able to hoist itself up to the level of its star...,2.5/4
8585,J.D.'s Revenge,"Despite a few entertaining moments and some strong performances, there's very little about this urban thriller that's worthy of mention.",48/100
8586,Jean-Michel Basquiat: The Radiant Child,"If The Radiant Child embellishes the legend in a hundred small ways, its cleverest maneuver is to keep its subject at enough of a remove to enhance his mystique.",3.5/5
8587,"Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles",A neglected classic.,4.5/5
8588,Jeepers Creepers,A nice change of pace from all of the teen slasher garbage that we've been getting of late.,6/10
8589,Jeepers Creepers 2,JC2 is a cheap creep that is certainly not worth the gold bullion it requires to venture out to a theater these days.,1/4
8590,Jeepers Creepers 3,"The film - though rife with Creeper action - is fairly light on any actual scares, [but] at the end of the day if you're a fan of the franchise, you'll be happy with this latest entry...",3.5/5
8591,Jeff Who Lives at Home,"If you can overlook the Duplass' signature crash zooms and affectations of self-awareness, there's a lot to love here.",3.5/5
8592,Jefferson in Paris,"What is it about? Revolution? History? Slavery? Romance? No doubt a lot of research and speculation went into Jhabvala's screenplay, but I wish she had finally decided to jump one way or the other. The movie tells no clear story and has no clear ideas.",2/4
8593,Jeffrey,It is startling that such a funny play is not so funny a movie.,2/4
8594,I am Yours,...a fairly run-of-the-mill character study that's elevated by star Amrita Acharia's spellbinding performance...,2.5/4
8595,Jellyfish Eyes,Takashi Murakami has invested the film with the same sort of primal pop-art aesthetic that distinguishes much of his art.,3/4
8596,Jem and the Holograms,"The worst adaptation of a Hasbro property yet, and that's saying a lot.",D
8597,Jen Kirkman: I'm Gonna Die Alone (And I Feel Fine),"She's a natural raconteur, and her show is a cleverly crafted and perfectly delivered monologue that feelsmore like a natural conversation with your funniest friend than a contrived comedy show.",4/5
8598,Jennifer 8,Somebody should have taken a hard look at the screenplay and decided that it wasn't finished.,1.5/4
8599,Jennifer's Body,The film itself isn't that great ... [but] underneath all of the stuff that doesn't quite work is a film about teenage girl best friends that is spectacular.,3/5
8600,Jenny Slate: Stage Fright,"Slate-like so many women-has more than one self, and she shows us a few of them in Stage Fright.",3.5/5
8601,Jenny's Wedding,"""Jenny's Wedding"" isn't ill-intentioned or actively bad; it's just a little too familiar, a little too safe and a little too satisfied with itself.",2/5
8602,Jeremiah Johnson,A very entertaining film that doesn't flinch about how tough life was for the early settlers.,3.5/5
8603,Jerichow,Jerichow is striking proof of the [Germany]'s resurgence as a hotbed of provocative new cinema.,3.5/4
8604,The Jerk,An early watered down version of the crude comedy the Farrelly Brothers would later take to new extremes.,2/5

8607,Jerry Before Seinfeld,"Seinfeld-before-""Seinfeld"" fans will especially enjoy this congenial, familiar hour special.",3/4
8608,Jerry Seinfeld: 23 Hours to Kill,He's out-of-date and out-of-step in this social media and now socially-distanced age...but that's kind of the point.,3/4
8609,Jersey Boys,It's entertaining musical biopic territory but rarely steps out of anything but caricature.,3/5
8610,Jersey Girl,"Kevin Smith's neuters his sense of humor for Jersey Girl, an old-fashioned ode to paternal love that shamelessly goes for its audience's tear ducts.",1.5/4
8611,Jersey Shore Massacre,"While the film fails to break any new ground in terms of the splatterflick genre, it's still entertaining enough to recommend, provided you have a strong stomach for vivisection and Italian stereotypes",2/4
8612,Jerusalem,"This IMAX spectacular largely does what it's supposed to: fascinate, educate, and visually wow the audience, in 45 minutes or less.",3/4
8613,Gangster's Paradise: Jerusalema,It's easy to overlook the formulas and just enjoy the ride.,3.5/5
8614,Jess + Moss,"Perhaps it is slightly too obtuse to really deliver a full emotional punch, but I nevertheless found this to be a mesmerising and beautiful film.",3.5/5
8615,Jessabelle,"Jessabelle delivers a handful of genuinely unsettling scares, which is more than a lot of horror films are bothering with these days.",6/10
8616,Jesus,"Like a Chilean Larry Clark, Guzzoni shows a talent for raw, unsettling storytelling.",3/5
8617,Jesus Camp,"Though too narrowly focused, considering the magnitude of its subject, religious brainwashing, docu is nonetheless relevant in pointing some of the educational and political effects of fanataic youth camps, in which kids are trained to be Jesus soldiers",B-
8618,Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter,The basic premise alone is worth the price of admission for this one.,4/5
8619,Jesus Henry Christ,"Pleasant without being revelatory, underwhelming but not obnoxiously so, the film explores how we become who we are, whether by genetics or environment or some combination of the two.",3/5

8621,Jesus' Son,This is not a drug movie like any you've seen.,3.5/4
8622,"Jesus, You Know","Thanks to the approach used in filming, the mundane and familiar problems that these people speak of become an informative & entertaining presentation of a collective pathos.",52/100
8623,Jet Lag,All the snappy dialogue in the world can't rescue this tried-and-true story.,1/5
8624,The Jewel of the Nile,It's to everybody's credit that The Jewel of the Nile is an ambitious and elaborate attempt to repeat the success of the first movie; it's not just a ripoff.,3/4
8625,Jews And Baseball: An American Love Story,"The organization, the writing by Ira Berkow, the footage, the research, all excellent. But it could have been so much more.",2/4
8626,Jewtopia,"You feel sorry for everyone who's working so hard to prop up the farce - especially Mr. Fogel, the director, whose work seems alternately desperate and lost.",1.5/5
8627,Jexi,"You would assume that Joker would've been the Hangover-related release of 2019 geared towards incels, but nah. That title belongs to this derivative, unfunny, lifeless comedy.",0.5/5
8628,Jhoom Barabar Jhoom,"While the humour is at times contrived, the curiosity factor and the slick style keeps you engaged.",2/5
8629,Jianyu (Reign of Assassins),"Reign of Assassins offers plenty of exciting sequences, but it frustratingly never fully delivers what it promises to.",3/5
8630,Stray Dogs,Every shot of Stray Dogs has been built with utter formal mastery; every sequence exerts an almost telepathic grip. This film could have been beamed to Venice from another planet.,5/5
8631,Jig,"A toe-tapping triumph for dance fans, though less so for non-converts.",3/5
8632,Jigsaw,"The cast just about sells it all ... making the brisk runtime fly by. You'll wince, you'll wile away 90 minutes, and you'll struggle to work it all out... what more do you expect from a Saw film?",3/5
8633,"Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond - Featuring a Very Special, Contractually Obligated Mention of Tony Clifton","Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond is, on the surface, Carrey's most obviously autobiographical film, a postmodern reflection on his art and influences.",3/5
8634,Jim Gaffigan: Cinco,"Over the last 15 years, Gaffigan has proven himself to be one of our most intelligent observational humorists, and that trend continues the 74-minute set that makes up Cinco.",B+
8635,Jim Gaffigan: Noble Ape,Noble Ape shows how Gaffigan's onstage persona can weather all storms and come out still getting the same laughs.,B
8636,Jim Gaffigan: Quality Time,"If that smacks suspiciously of brand solidification after the near career-derailment Jeannie's illness temporarily brought about, Quality Time is at least quality old-school Gaffigan.",B
8637,Jim: The James Foley Story,"""Jim"" is at once an intimate portrait of a restless spirit and a family's journey to understand him, as well as a treatise on the state of international conflict journalism and world news in today's market.",A-
8638,Jimi: All Is by My Side,"An unpredictable film, a difficult approximation of a biopic. But it delivers a Jimi Hendrix experience somehow the richer for sidelining the man and subverting his music.",4/5

8659,Joe,"I admire the film's gusto to look at the hippie era, but its shock factor is more of a bail out rather than letting the story reach a meaningful conclusion.",68/100
8660,Joe,"Cage excels as Joe here: amongst all of the larger-than-life southern characters in the film, Cage's performance seems almost subdued and he is completely convincing.",3/5
8661,Joe Dirt,The movie isn't too good.,C-
8662,Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser,"So much is random and lame here, handed little consideration before being committed to a hard drive. ""Joe Dirt 2"" is an awful film, absolutely unwatchable and depressing.",F
8663,Joe Kidd,"All I can tell you about Clint Eastwood in Joe Kidd is that he plays a ruthless gunman of few words. This isn't exactly a surprise... The funny thing about Joe Kidd, though, is that we can't keep straight whose side he's on, or why.",2/4

8666,Joe the King,The film is so steeped in resentment that it's not able to pull back and let us see the boy behind the shield of his misery.,2/4
8667,Joe Versus the Volcano,"Joe Versus the Volcano achieves a kind of magnificent goofiness. Hanks and Ryan are the right actors to inhabit it, because you can never catch them going for a gag that isn't there: They inhabit the logic of this bizarre world and play by its rules.",3.5/4
8668,Joe's Apartment,A harmless no-brainer.,2/4
8669,Joffrey: Mavericks of American Dance,"There's a lot of valuable information here, but for all the archival footage on view, dance is rarely allowed to make its effect.",2.5/5
8670,John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars,In a summer of really rotten movies it still stands out for its wretchedness...has the air of something falling several rungs below straight-to-video standards.,F

8680,John Mulaney: Kid Gorgeous at Radio City,"For a guy whose eagerness to both please and admit his own lack of personal authority is so central to his act, politics would appear to be a tricky tonal minefield to navigate. But Mulaney's inevitable Trump material is brilliantly crafted.",A-
8681,John Mulaney: The Comeback Kid,"You can tell why two broadcast networks and no less an esteemed comedy maven as Lorne Michaels thought John Mulaney should be a TV star. The stand-up comedian is great on camera, as he repeatedly demonstrates in his new hour-long special.",A

8787,Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.,Just Another Girl on the I.R.T. ultimately offers a welcome glimpse of one of the individuals behind the sea of faces racing by in the subway cars -- the kind of face and individual that Hollywood customarily has never given a second look.,3/5
8788,Just Before I Go,"Deplorable, ugly and mean.",F
8789,Just Between Friends,Watching this film is the damnedest experience because it labors over the smallest points of the most inconsequential scenes and then hurries past the big emotional climaxes.,1.5/4

9052,Koyaanisqatsi - Life Out of Balance,"What makes this film great is its structure, the fact that photography, editing and music alone can combine to form an epic, 90-minute composition that coheres.",4/4

9056,The Krays,"The movie is not simply a catalog of stabbings, garrotings and bloodletting. It goes deeper than into the twisted pathology of twins whose faces would light up with joy when their mom told them they looked just like proper gentlemen.",3.5/4
9057,The Kreutzer Sonata,"Bold, brilliant and exhilarating: an intimately horrible, sexually explicit and black-comic portrait of a toxic marriage.",4/5
9058,Die Nibelungen: Kriemhilds Rache (Kriemhild's Revenge),No one does a revenge tale better than Lang.,B+
9059,Krippendorf's Tribe,"Is it possible to recommend a whole comedy on the basis of one scene that made you laugh almost uncontrollably? I fear not. And yet Krippendorf's Tribe has such a scene, and many comedies have none.",2/4
9060,Kris (Crisis),"Bookended with unnecessary off screen narrative descriptions of the idyllic village, Crisis unfolds as a simplistic morality play with one dimensional cardboard cutout characters.",C
9061,Kronk's New Groove,"It's just too generic, and generic is not what we want from a sequel to a film that managed to escape the Disney mold.",2/5
9062,Krrish,"A young man with superhuman powers doubles as Krrish, a masked hero, in a Bollywood sequel that blends carefree romance, show-stopping action and sci-fi.",3/5

9074,Kung Fu Killer,Some of the fight scenes are dazzling in their speed and complexity.,4/5
9075,Kung Fu Panda,"The colorful locale and battles, not the message, are the thing in this hybrid of family fare and martial arts in which Jack Black is too cute as the chubby misfit-hero but it's Dustin Hoffman and Ian McShane who steal the show with their ironic delivery",B-
9076,Kung Fu Panda 3,"While visually gorgeous and generally entertaining, this third installment of the DreamWorks Animation franchise is a comedown from the first two superb entries.",6/10

9087,L'Iceberg,"Physical comedy in cinema so rarely rises above a kind of kick-the-cajones mediocrity, so Iceberg is a more than welcome breath of fresh air.",3.5/4
9088,The Double Hour,"Suffice it to say that the twists and turns in The Double Hour are not arbitrary; rather, they are well considered and effective, right down to the last frame.",3/5
9089,La Bamba,"This is a sincere, well-acted movie about the short life of a minor rock 'n' roll star, and by the time it's over we almost have the feeling Valens would have been surprised not to have died in a crash.",3/4
9090,La belle endormie (The Sleeping Beauty),...plays like a Narnia tale in which the underlying lesson is not on the laws of Christianity but sexual awakening.,B-
9091,La Belle Noiseuse,"Obviously, the film is aimed at a fairly narrow audience -- primarily the art community. But the passion felt during those painting-and-posing sequences reaches a much broader spectrum.",3/4

9096,The Blue Room (La chambre bleue),"Amalric's handling is cool, studied and perhaps a little self-conscious. But he does a good job of showing how adultery is a noose that tightens at the throat even before an actual crime is committed ...",3/5

9123,La tête en friche (My Afternoons with Margueritte),"Depardieu's the best he's been for years, while 95-year-old Casadesus is a sheer delight.",4/5
9124,La Vie en Rose (La Mome),"As French legendary icon Piaf, Cotillard gives such an emotioanlly riveting perfromance that she singlehandedly elevates the episodic biopic way above its melodramatic trappings; her perfect lip-synching of je ne regrette rien is amazing to behold",B+
9125,Labor Day,A full-immersion exercise in the old-fashioned women's weepie that skews far closer to Nicholas Sparks' brand of contrivance than Diablo Cody territory.,C
9126,Labyrinth,"Great energy and creativity went into the construction, production and direction of this movie, but it doesn't have a story that does justice to the production.",2/4

9132,Lady and the Tramp,"With cracking music, a rollicking pace and dialogue that stands up to scrutiny, Lady and the Tramp really is among Walt's very best.",4/5
9133,Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp's Adventure,Made without much of the original Lady and the Tramp's spirit in mind.,5/10
9134,Lady Bird,"A sweet, deeply personal portrayal of female adolescence that's more attuned to the bonds between best girlfriends than casual flings with boys, writer-director Greta Gerwig's beautiful Lady Bird flutters with the attractively loose rhythms of youth.",5/5
9135,The Lady Eve,"A movie like The Lady Eve is so hard to make that you can't make it at all unless you find a way to make it seem effortless. Preston Sturges does a kind of breathless balancing act here, involving romance, deception and physical comedy.",4/4

9141,Lady Jane,Staid and off-center.,3/5
9142,Lady L,"Whatever the causes of the minor disatisfactions inherent in this film, its major rewards are due to Peter Ustinov's sensitive conception and superb direction.",4/5

9144,Lady on a Train,Deanna Durbin sparkles in this farcical murder-mystery.,B

9151,Lagerfeld Confidential,Lagerfeld Confidential lives up to its title by keeping its central topic top secret.,1.5/4
9152,Laggies,The plot strong-arms the characters into increasingly contrived and overly familiar positions that leave you longing for the more relaxed vibe of Shelton's earlier films.,3/5
9153,The Lair of the White Worm,"Russell was once, and no doubt will be again, considered an important director. This is the sort of exercise he could film with one hand tied behind his back, and it looks like that was indeed more or less his approach.",2/4
9154,Lake City,"Quaintly shot and paced, not unlike Shotgun Stories, but insanely over-written, Lake City dumps on audiences a plot that consists of 500-some-odd puzzle pieces that all come together exactly as you expect.",2/4
9155,The Lake House,"A supernatural romantic melodrama in the vein of Ghost, though not as trashily enjoyable or charmingly sexy, this enigmatic movie, a remake of a mediocre Korean meller, reteams Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves for the first time since Speed.",2/5
9156,Lake Michigan Monster,"Grab a bottle of rum (or two), gather together some of your idiot friends, cast off your high-brow cinematic pretensions, and cue up this 78 minutes of nonsensical nautical mayhem.",6.5/10
9157,Lake of Fire,"Lake wants to break through decades of encrusted rhetoric to make us think again. With one slow reveal of Norma McCorvey, a.k.a. 'Jane Roe,' the movie upends all you assumed about this subject.",3.5/4
9158,Lake Placid,About the only thing that rescues LAKE PLACID from drecksville is Kelley's flair for sarcastic dialogue.,3/5
9159,Lake Tahoe,It ultimately sags under the weight of its bloated silences and stagnant story line.,2.5/4

9163,Lambert & Stamp,"[VIDEO ESSAY] Even if you've never heard of ""The Who,"" as improbable as that seems, ""Lambert & Stamp"" is an infectiously captivating retelling of that brilliant band's origin and strange journeys...",A
9164,Land Ho!,"While Land Ho! is easy to admire and appreciate in its quiet observations and tender form, the movie's restraint is such that it travels distances, but never quite gets to its destination in a way that's ever truly moving or engrossing.",C+
9165,Land of Mine (Under Sandet),The performances are uniformly excellent.,4/5
9166,Land of Silence and Darkness (Land des Schweigens und der Dunkelheit),Watching and hearing Fini treat her patients is like watching Bob Ross paint.,3.5/4
9167,Land of the Dead,"the film works best on that deliciously, subversively subliminal level, twisting its metaphor of exploited underclasses",4/5
9168,Land of the Pharaohs,No wars; no battles; one dinky sword fight. But much pageantry.,5/10
9169,Landline,"Robespierre has done something that has become increasingly rare lately, and that's make a family comedy with characters that actually seem like a family.",3/5

9175,L'Argent,A work of true cinematic genius that stands head and shoulders above most other pictures and seems to defy critical judgment.,5/5
9176,Larger Than Life,"Manages to eke out only infrequent, peanut-size pleasures along its lumbering way.",2/4
9177,Heartbreaker (L'Arnacoeur),There are many laugh-out-loud moments -- one featuring Dirty Dancing is brilliant -- and the film is a delight from start to finish.,4/5
9178,Larry Crowne,Hanks fans will revel in their hero's hour in this innocuous tale that's well intentioned for all its mediocre happenings and foreseeable ending.,3/5
9179,Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector,That's how awful this picture is. It can't even come up with new diarrhea jokes.,F
9180,Lassie,The combination of everyone's favourite canine and eye-catching Irish and Isle of Man locations ensure this nostalgic shaggy-dog story sends you home with your tail wagging.,3/5

9182,Lassiter,Another Tom Selleck clinker.,1/5
9183,Lasso,Young care worker Simon makes an unlikely hero in a genre that usually focuses on women but keeps viewers rooting for him throughout much of the running time.,3/5
9184,Last Action Hero,"There is a lot of action in Last Action Hero, but the underlying story never ever quite works.",2.5/4

9188,The Last Castle,Making every single murderer and rapist into a sympathetic character is going way too far.,5/10
9189,Last Chance Harvey,"An unambitious romance aimed at grown-ups, it deserves the handful of champions it will find, but probably not the Oscar campaign it's heading into.",3.5/5
9190,Last Day of Summer,A Stockholm Syndrome saga giving new meaning to the term 'Shotgun Wedding!',3/4
9191,Last Days,"With its long, contemplative stretches sans dialogue and its characters' stuttering, fuzzy rhythms, Last Days is one of the most honest, hyperbole-free big-screen depictions of heroin addiction.",4/5
9192,Last Days Here,"The documentarians make a good case that anyone can be redeemed, even a zonked out, washed up heavy metal singer.",B
9193,Last Days In The Desert,Arresting visuals and a magnificent performance by Ewan McGregor make this a cut above most religious fare.,6/10

9198,The Last Exorcism,It's hard to be frightened by something when you're too busy laughing at it.,5/10
9199,Last Flag Flying,"Four powerhouse performances cannot quite make Richard Linklater's occasionally moving dramedy, Last Flag Flying, into more than a minor war movie.",6/10
9200,The Last Flight of Noah's Ark,"Parents know Disney movies are OK to send the kids to because there won't be any nudity or profanity. But isn't it also poisonous for kids to be exposed to stupid characters, lame-brained plots and humorless 'gags?'",0.5/4

9205,The Last Hurrah,.,2.5/5
9206,The Last King of Scotland,"This politicized Faustian tale is a provocative and shrewd blend of fact and fiction in the case of a naive doctor seduced into Amin's political apparatus, but film suffers from problems of other political-horror sagas told from strictly white POV.",B+
9207,The Last Kiss,"Entertaining and insightful, but the shift from comedy to melodrama is a bit drastic.",3/5
9208,Last Knights,"Another macho celebration of fighting for ""freedom"" because someone else told you to, devoid of any acknowledgement of the inherent irony of that ideology.",1/4

9216,Last of the Red Hot Lovers,"Based on the humorous Neil Simon play of the same name, this film is not nearly so funny.",1/4
9217,Last Ounce of Courage,"Filled with flawed ideas, subtle bigotry, and amateurish technique, Last Ounce of Courage tested my last ounce of patience.",0.5/4
9218,Last Passenger,"Instead of submitting entirely to formula, the movie attempts something seldom seen on the screen, trying to make the idea of a monster more frightening than the constant demands of one.",B
9219,The Last Picture Show,"doesn't shy away from the inherent awkwardness of life, but instead embraces it with an elegiac sensitivity that sidesteps Peyton Place-style melodrama and turns small-town anomie and the dead ends of life into stark cinematic poetry",4/4

9229,The Last Time I Saw Paris,What is to be said of such a picture? The story is trite. The motivations are thin. The writing is glossy and pedestrian. The acting is pretty much forced.,1.5/5

9243,Late Phases,"Adrin Garca Bogliano ends up merely toying with the death-steeped concerns of his characters, and taking the furious and bitter perspective that powers the narrative's ponderous dramatic core for granted.",2.5/4
9244,The Late Show,Carney and Tomlin make a fine odd couple in this tip of the hat to old-time detective thrillers.,4/5
9245,Latter Days,"Cox, who wrote Sweet Home Alabama, again trades heavily in stereotype and coincidence for his directing debut.",2/4
9246,Laugh Killer Laugh,"It is a grim, dark, and sometimes violent gangster film.",6/10
9247,Laura Smiles,"The movie's muddy, overexposed look is tough on the eyes, but its unrelentingly bleak take on the land of supermarkets and car dealerships is not without its share of dark humor, and it thankfully eschews easy answers.",3/6
9248,Laurel Canyon,"If Laurel Canyon isn't quite as daring as it thinks it is, it is an always honest, often stirring movie.",3/5
9249,Laurence Anyways,"It's just too damn much, frankly.",C+
9250,Lavender,"[Cornish gives] a great performance, and it's disappointing that the movie around her isn't worthy of it.",2/5

9252,L'Avventura,L'Avventura becomes a place in our imagination -- a melancholy moral desert.,4/4
9253,Law Abiding Citizen,"The big problem with the movie isn't the violence, or the message about coddling criminals, or the two lead actors, although they've never been worse. It's the utter implausibility.",1/4
9254,Law of Desire,"A bold, daring work that is as shocking and impressive today as it was nearly 20 years ago when it was first released.",5/5
9255,Lawless,"Hillcoat's film wins its gasps and gulps honestly, but it doesn't remotely strain against the constraints of genre in the same way as last two equally Western-inflected films, The Proposition and The Road.",3/5
9256,Lawless Heart,"Honest, poignant and occasionally very, very witty.",3.5/5
9257,Lawman,"If you're a fan of westerns or you simply enjoy your action movies presented with some deeper concepts than ""kill 'em all,"" this forgotten little flick is worth a look.",72/100
9258,The Lawnmower Man,"The Lawnmower Man tries to hit all the points of dogma about Virtual Reality, but it's getting to be such a large text that each point only gets a mention.",2.5/5
9259,Lawnmower Man 2 - Jobe's War (Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace),"Mowing the lawn might be more involving than watching this subpar sci-fi sequel, which manages to be complicated and witless at the same time.",1.5/4
9260,Lawrence of Arabia,"We remember the quiet, empty passages, the sun rising across the desert, the intricate lines traced by the wind in the sand.",4/4
9261,Laws of Attraction,Julianne Moore currently essays maybe the most obnoxious white woman in a Hollywood movie since Erin Brockovich.,1.5/4
9262,Lay the Favorite,It's a decidedly soft-boiled tale populated by some of the nicest degenerate gamblers you'd ever want to meet.,B-
9263,Layer Cake,"While it's visually striking, with superior acting, it's also cluttered with a bewildering collection of characters and plot threads.",2/5
9264,The Lazarus Project,"For all this grumbling, The Lazarus Project is technically a well put together film. It looks good, and is reasonably well acted.",2.5/5
9265,Lazer Team,"There's a reason why Rooster Teeth easily tripled their IndieGoGo asking price, and that's because people knew they'd create a witty sci-fi satire with intergalactic dick jokes ""sprinkled"" in - and the people were right.",7/10
9266,Lazy Eye,Writer-director Tim Kirkman tries to peg depth of character on the character of Dean instead of having him earn it.,0/4
9267,Lazy Susan,Susan is more of a collection of quirks and bad choices. There just isn't much to her.,1.5/4
9268,LBJ,The film around Harrelson is utterly undistinguished.,2/5
9269,Change of Plans (Le Code a Changé),"Change of Plans, Danile Thompson's skillfully executed comedy of manners, is either deeply profound or insupportably shallow--most likely the latter.",2/4
9270,The Decline of the American Empire (Le Déclin de l'Empire Américain),"Here is a movie where everybody talks about nothing but sex, and the real subject is wit.",3/4

9273,Le amiche,Antonioni does a strong job deftly directing the intense multi-layered psychological melodrama.,A
9274,Le Cercle Rouge,This is a transitional film that makes way for a 'New Wave' of crime films soon to follow.,A
9275,Le Deuxième souffle (Second Breath),"The product of a director in complete control of his talents, Second Breath musters enough depth that by its conclusion it feels only nominally like a heist film.",82/100
9276,Le Doulos,It's a dark post-noir thriller enhanced by superb performances and sparkling black and white cinematography.,A-
9277,Le Havre,"Minor pleasures abound, but Kauismki's vision isn't deep enough to survive so many variations.",B-
9278,Le Jour se lève (Daybreak),What brings this film into greatness is the absolutely pitch-perfect lucid performance by Gabin.,A

9280,Le nom des gens (The Names of Love),This cross-cultural comedy-drama sports a bubbly performance by Sara Forestier.,B
9281,Le passé (The Past),"There is so much that Farhadi and his latest film does right, and does well...Mature and real in a way that dramas rarely aspire too, The Past posits that sometimes the only way to move on from where you've been, is to turn around and face it",B
9282,Le Petit Lieutenant,director Xavier Beauvois uses the investigation of one crime...to string together a character piece that is as much about the character of a Parisian homicide squad within a police department as it is a study of some of the individuals who comprise it.,B
9283,Le samouraï,"Alain Delon, who was attacked by some narrow-minded reviewers in his day for being stiff, is perfectly cast here, displaying a cool, calm demeanor at first, then an equally calm desperation as the chase gets more intense.",3.5/4
9284,Le Week-End,"With Michell anchoring proceedings in his usual unfussy manner, what stands out most is Kureishi's perfectly polished diamond of a script.",4/5
9285,The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,A squandered opportunity that begins with big ambitions then scuttles for the safety of action movie cliches.,1/5
9286,A League of Their Own,"From its jokey, one-note characters to its endless baseball montages, A League of Their Own is all flash, all surface: It's a great big trailer for itself.",C+
9287,Lean on Me,"Lean on Me is not a documentary about the real Joe Clark. It is a fiction film about a character who is so troubled, obsessed and angry that the film is never able to say quite what it thinks of him. After the movie, neither are we.",2.5/4
9288,Lean on Pete,"If this story of a lonely young life lived on the hoof leaves us craving stillness and closeness, then surely that's mission accomplished.",4/5
9289,Leap!,The film's careful attention to detail in the animation is continuously undermined by a formulaic plot and anxious pandering to contemporary sensibilities.,2/4
9290,Leap Year,Predictable as hell but delivering exactly what's advertised ... the rapport between Adams and Goode is often enough to keep this movie from totally sinking into its own formula-driven plot.,6.5/10
9291,Leap Year (Año bisiesto),"Leap Year is well handled but confronting to the core, taking you to a very dark place.",4/5
9292,Learning To Drive,"An amiable, well-meaning story of fellow feeling extending across social boundaries, there's a kind of built-in worthiness to the premise that suggests something a lot duller and more tin-eared than Coixet's film delivers.",B-
9293,Least Among Saints,"As a portrait of a self-pitying drunk's wet dream of inexplicable atonement, it's fairly effective, but as a story meant to take place on some rational version of planet Earth, it's utterly hopeless.",0/4
9294,Leatherface,"There is never much sense of hope in the film, only a brash defiance that sometimes, for all its ugliness, verges on the heroic.",4/5
9295,Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III,"Believe it or not, even horror movie fans like some meat in their stories. You should pardon the expression.",0/4
9296,Leatherheads,"Though choppy, only mildly entertaining, and not really witty, Clooney's sports comedy deserves some credit for its courageous effort to recreate Hollywood's suave screwball comedies.",C
9297,Leave Her to Heaven,Classic story of the ultimate narcissist.,4/5
9298,Leave it on the Floor,The standout film for me at both the (2011) L.A. Film Festival and Outfest. Spectacular and joyous.,B+

9300,Leave No Trace,The film is consistently at its best when it's attuned to a quiet sense of harmony between all things.,B
9301,Leave The World Behind,"Leave The World Behind is a slightly shallow, yet still entertaining documentary about one of EDM's most influential groups.",7/10
9302,"Leaving Home, Coming Home: A Portrait of Robert Frank","The most enjoyable parts of this moving documentary show Frank with his second wife, the sculptor June Leaf - a wonderfully feisty woman who has sustained him throughout.",4/5
9303,Leaving Las Vegas,"A unique movie about fulfillment through love - the love of a man, a woman, and a bottle. It also has two of the best acting performances of the year.",3.5/4
9304,Lebanon (Levanon),In atmospheric terms the film does its job almost ruinously well.,3/5
9305,"Lebanon, Pa.",A transitional time in the life of a 35-year-old ad agency executive when he has a chance to take a hard look at his life.,4/5
9306,L'Eclisse,"[In] Antonioni's version of science fiction, he allows the incredible to be implied.",5/5
9307,Lee Daniels' The Butler,"An ambitious, sweeping period drama that manages to be incredibly affecting and feel as if the words ''For Your Consideration'' are stamped across every frame.",B+

9309,Left Behind: The Movie,A little hard to believe.,C
9310,Left on Purpose,"A moving and consciousness-expanding documentary about a radical who wants his death to be like his life -- on his terms, and with a political purpose,",3/4
9311,Legacy: Black Ops,"Aspiring for psychological drama rather than action movie, the film takes itself far too seriously.",2/5
9312,Legacy of Lies,Action movie with a pro-free speech message; violence.,3/5
9313,Legal Eagles,"The movie has so much stuff in it, it's top-heavy. The wonder is that so many scenes play as well as they do.",2.5/4
9314,Legally Blonde,Luketic neither commands the kind of broad satirical strokes heir to Alexander Payne or the low-key absurdist touches that mark the works of Wes Anderson.,2.5/4
9315,"Legally Blonde 2 - Red, White & Blonde","While the first ""Legally Blonde"" quite impressed me as a fun and funny solid film, ""Red White & Blonde"" doesn't fill the high-heeled shoes.",1.5/4
9316,Legend,"As this big, brash ode to these brassnecked chancers shows, they succeeded in building a legend even if they failed to create an empire. Perhaps it's what they would have wanted.",3/5
9317,The Legend of 1900 (La leggenda del pianista sull'oceano),"The Legend of 1900 has moments of great imagination: a scene, for example, where the piano rolls back and forth across the polished dance floor in a storm, and 1900 keeps on playing. But it never quite develops the conviction we expect.",2.5/4
9318,The Legend of Bagger Vance,It is enjoyable in spite of its heavy sentimentality.,3/4
9319,The Legend of Billie Jean,This far-fetched movie munches on the mythology of heroism but is too manipulative and shallow to be taken seriously.,2/5
9320,The Legend of Drunken Master (Jui kuen II) (Drunken Fist II),Jackie Chan in top form.,B
9321,The Legend of Hell House,Classic ghost story inspires as many yawns as it does chills.,66/100
9322,The Legend of Johnny Lingo,"A good-natured but somewhat slack family film...rather stilted and didactic, like a Disney live-action feature from the fifties or sixties.",C
9323,Die Stille nach dem Schuß (The Legend of Rita) (The Legends of Rita),"The Legend of Rita doesn't adopt a simplistic political view. It's not propaganda for either side, but the story of how the division and reunification of Germany swept individual lives away indifferently in its tide.",3.5/4
9324,Legend Of The Demon Cat (Kûkai),"It starts on a promising note, with the first half being an intriguing murder mystery -- the emperor has just been killed and all signs point to his heir being the next target. But by the later half, everything spirals out of control.",3/5
9325,Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen,...a seriously misguided action epic.,1.5/4
9326,Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole,Legend of the Guardians is a milestone for animation and 3D.,A-

9331,Legends of the Fall,"Unless you are a big fan of seeing hearts cut out of the bodies of animals and people or unless you feel you must see all of Brad Pitt's movies (he is major handsome), I can see no reason to see this film other than as a long travelogue.",1.5/4
9332,Legion,"When all is said and done, Legion is all talk and no ""do"", a prude film with some seriously wasted potential. It's boring, slow-paced and takes itself way too goddamn seriously.",1/5
9333,Legion of Brothers,"There's some bitterness on display, plenty of sadness, and an abundance of camaraderie. But mostly, there's just an impressive frankness - about both tragedies and triumphs.",2/5

9337,Len and Company,"""Len And Company"" is not a song that's out of tune, so much as one that's forgettable.",C-
9338,L'Enfant,The infant grabs hold of the viewer's heart with his sheer vulnerability and dependence on parents who are only beginning to learn how to take care of themselves.,3.5/5
9339,Sister,Excels as both a social critique and a poignant tale of emotional vulnerability.,B+
9340,L'Enfer d'Henri-Georges Clouzot (Henri-George Clouzot's Inferno),Superbly portrays the truly extraordinary and inventive vision this doomed movie could have unleashed upon the world.,4/5

9351,Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood,"The film's not good, exactly, but it's certainly miles beyond the last two episodes...",2/4
9352,Leprechaun: Origins,"Even the cheapest, most shoddy productions can manage some thrills, kills, and laughs with memorable characters and a cohesive plot when skilled filmmakers are at the helm. Leprechaun: Origins, unfortunately, offers none of these things.",0.9/10
9353,Leprechaun Returns,"With some riotously inventive kills, a load of silly humour, and a few throwbacks to the original, Returns should please long-time fans of the series and newcomers alike.",8/10
9354,Leroy & Stitch,"Frankly, Leroy & Stitch looked to me like no more than an extended version of one of Disney's Lilo & Stitch television episodes.",4/10
9355,Les Plages d'Agnès (The Beaches of Agnes),"Varda's luminous depiction of a life lived well is entertaining, informative, and finally, inspirational.",4/5

9362,Lesbian Vampire Killers,"The entire project is a crushingly lazy attempt to create a piece of titillating, exploitative horror-comedy that manages to achieve none of its aims. A mirthless, joyless experience, this is a movie with absolutely nothing going for it.",1/5
9363,Leslie Jones: Time Machine,"Time Machine is one of those exceptional stand-up specials that can get a laugh out of anyone, from any demographic-and that's the power of Leslie Jones.",B+
9364,Less Than Zero,"A movie that knows cocaine inside out and paints a portrait of drug addiction that is all the more harrowing because it takes place in the Beverly Hills fast lane, in a world of wealth, sex, glamour and helpless self-destruction.",4/4
9365,Lessons of Darkness,Lays the groundwork for Herzog's masterpiece Aguirre: The Wrath of God.,3/4
9366,Let Fury Have The Hour,"On a political level, the film is far from a Godardian dialectic, so the view of history that emerges is, to say the least, blinkered.",2/4
9367,Let Him Have It,"In his reconstruction of the trial, Medak is unforgiving, showing a legal system less concerned with justice than with proving itself correct.",3.5/4

9369,Let It Ride,Close Encounters of the worst kind,2/5
9370,Let It Snow,"This is the most cliché holiday romantic comedy imaginable, with not a single district trait worth highlighting. Not to mention, the performances are notably bad alongside some inexcusably bad attempts at jokes",1/5
9371,Let Me In,"Ultimately, if the Swedish version is near perfection, Matt Reeves's version achieves complete supremacy. Masterpiece is an overused word, but it's hard to think of another so powerful. Let Me In is the new standard for vampire movies.",5/5

9379,Let Us Prey,"Debut director Brian O'Malley has crafted an intriguing horror flick that, aside from a few cheap scares, attempts to avoid tired clichs.",3/5
9380,Lethal Weapon,...Lethal Weapon remains one of those rare 1980s action films that passed the test of time.,7/10

9385,Let's Be Evil,I recommend this one only for die-hard fans of killer kids horror.,2.5/5
9386,Let's Do It Again,"Let's Do It Again isn't a terribly ambitious comedy, but within its limitations it works well. And it's completely good natured.",3/4
9387,Let's Get Lost,"Nothing about this movie settles into normalcy. It's a celebration, a memorial, a tease, a death knell.",A-
9388,Let's Go to Prison,"Since this stars Dax Shepard, a more appropriate title for Prison might've been Relentlessly Awful, Laugh-Free, Cinematic Torture Device.",F

9390,Let's Make Love,Safe to skip.,2.5/5
9391,Let's Scare Jessica to Death,"Let's Scare Jessica to Death spends 90 minutes tapping lightly but incessantly on its heroine's fragile sanity, as though it were some sort of Faberg S&M model egg.",1.5/4
9392,Let's Talk About Sex,"The film's hilariously overblown housework-as-grieving climax, complete with cleanser cans being thrown in frustration, has to be a cinema landmark of some sort.",0/4
9393,Letter From an Unknown Woman,"Watching it is like finding a locket you thought you had lost, one which contains the picture of someone who once broke your heart.",5/5
9394,A Letter to Three Wives,Sharp and bright multi-character film from Mankiewicaz at his best.,5/5
9395,Letters From Baghdad,"Tilda Swinton is the perfect choice to read the letters of Gertrude Bell - archeologist, explorer, mountaineer and spy.",3/5
9396,Letters from Iwo Jima,Eastwood finds more to say in defeat than he does in victory.,4.5/5
9397,Letters To God,"While Letters to God is certainly family-friendly, the blandness robs it of whatever emotion or redemption the filmmakers were shooting for.",1.5/4
9398,Letters to Juliet,"Diabetics steer clear; so awfully saccharine is the derivative romantic drama Letters to Juliet, it may induce a hyperglycemic coma.",1.5/5

9406,Lez Bomb,"While rarely feeling heavy-handed, Lez Bomb manages to be both over-the-top funny and yet incredibly realistic, sans the doom and gloom of yesteryear.",3.5/5
9407,L!fe Happens,A mildly amusing indie that's neither as funny nor as poignant as it wants to be.,B-
9408,LFO: The Movie,"Tublen's last-act feels like a purposefully cheap gag, but LFO is nevertheless a consistently humorous lo-fi sci-fi story.",3/5
9409,Liam Gallagher: As It Was,An even better insight into the Liam's world than his tweets.,3/5
9410,Lianna,"Marred by some stilted performances, a painfully dated soundtrack, and an opening half-hour that skirts the razor's edge of painful didacticism.",2/4
9411,Libeled Lady,"Classic screwball farce. Not as funny as it might be, but worthwhile.",4/5
9412,Liberal Arts,Josh Radnor's second foray as a director is a major triumph. Goes to show you that some of the best romances can be about an exchange of emotion and ideas rather than an exchange of fluids.,8/10

9414,Liberty Heights,"Both epic and intimate, taking on a large cast of characters while focusing quietly on the details of their lives.",B+
9415,Liberty Kid,Chaiken's focus drives home the fact that collateral damage comes in many forms and marginal lives are easily derailed.,3/4
9416,Liberty Stands Still,"A ripe-on-the-vine concept married to strident execution. There's thought here, but Liberty is marred by vague, freshman directorial touches.",C-
9417,The Librarian: Quest for the Spear,"It's a fun cheesy cable TV flick, a slice of winking B movie giddiness that charms us into smiling through all the nonsense.",3/5
9418,Licence To Kill,The best part of this movie is Dalton's performance as Bond.,3/4
9419,License to Drive,"Up until about the halfway mark of this movie, I was having a very good time. Then, somehow, it ran out of energy.",2.5/4
9420,The Lickerish Quartet,"It all sounds risible on paper, but the immediate effects are rather powerful.",4/4
9421,Lies & Alibis,"Delves into a standard caper film full of cons and double-crosses. And as those types of films go, it's really not too bad.",3/4

9423,Life,"There are some pleasing touches, but this film is a frustrating experience.",2/5
9424,Life,"A welcome addition to the genre, although it is slower and more grounded in reality than the science fiction movies to which modern audiences have become accustomed.",B+
9425,Life 2,"Not so much a documentary of an Internet phenomenon as a deconstruction of 21st-century culture, Jason Spingarn-Koff's unsettling film explores the online game Second Life, in which players create avatars to live in a virtual world.",3.5/4
9426,"Life, Above All","Bernhard Jasper's cinematography, under Oliver Schmitz's direction, is at once funky and elegant while the scrip... is inspiring without resorting to any cheap sentimentality.",3/4

9434,The Life Before Her Eyes,...an intricately-plotted and richly conceived drama...,3/4
9435,Life During Wartime,"As a showcase for Tucci's comic skills, ""The Alarmist"" succeeds. We start the film feeling buoyed by his roosterlike energy and audacity, and we end it feeling let down by a script that can't quite decide what it wants to say.",2/4

9527,Little Fugitive,"A remarkable indy classic, made on a shoestring budget.",A
9528,Little Giants,"Working in two platoons, [the four screenwriters] have skillfully removed all vestiges of originality from this story, and turned in a perfectly-honed retread of every other movie about how a team of losers wins the big game.",1/4

9531,Little Jerusalem,Somber and nuanced but prone to self-annotation.,2/4
9532,Little Joe,"None of this is represented in any compelling dramatic style, and the actors - all very talented and assured - have perhaps not had clear enough direction. It is a mood piece. Whose mood leads nowhere.",2/5
9533,Little Man,"In the search for gags involving inappropriate contact between adults and a supposed child, the film doesn't overlook an orifice or an excretion.",D+
9534,Little Man,A powerful and challenging documentary that will affect audiences long after they've passed through the lobby.,4/5

9536,Little Manhattan,A totem to white privilege.,1.5/4

9539,The Little Mermaid: Ariel's Beginning,Perfectly watchable yet not entirely memorable.,3/5
9540,Little Miss Sunshine,just when you thought the concept of dysfunctional family has been exhausted along comes this enormously likable if structurally flawed road comedy that has the potential to become a hit beyond the indie milieu if picked by the right distributor.,B+

9543,Little Nicky,"The story plods along, punctuated by gags that are more silly than inventive.",1/5
9544,Little Nikita,"It turns all of the characters into chess pieces, whose relationships depend on the plot, not on human chemistry. Since the plot is absurdly illogical, you're not left with much.",1.5/4
9545,Little Odessa,"[Little Odessa] is neither a family drama nor a crime melodrama, but a series of disconnected scenes that play like exercises -- some of them very good ones.",2/4
9546,Little Pink House,The film is mostly a sobering dramatization of a true and controversial story in recent Connecticut history.,2.5/4
9547,Little Red Wagon,"""Little Red Wagon"" almost seems better suited for a made-for-TV, Lifetime movie.",2/4

9654,Loot,"As periodically enticing as the film's mysteries may be, it's hard to escape the feeling that the real story lies in what Marder has left off the screen.",2/4
9655,Lootera,"It's not at all trite to state that by the hauntingly bittersweet end, everything magically falls into place, for there is true magic in Motwane's mastery in crafting a such a poetic, passionately felt, and perfectly realized work of art.",4/4

9684,Lost Boys: The Tribe,"It's ridiculous that Warner made this movie, especially because it's obvious that it was made to cash in on the film's title. This in no way shape or form is a LOST BOYS movie, other than the fact that Corey Feldman and Corey Haim cameo...",1/5

9713,Louis C.K.: 2017,"Louis C.K. toggles between grouchy and apologetic, his two most oft-used standup comedy gears. He does this to such perfection that even the few moments when the content is weak or a tad forced, he still has his audience on the floor.",3/4
9714,"Louise Bourgeois: The Spider, the Mistress and the Tangerine","Frequently roving around and taking awe at Bourgeois's massive artwork, the filmmakers may understand the artist as a woman and a living creature but they often treat her as if she herself were a museum piece.",2/4

9721,Love Actually,[Richard Curtis is] a smart enough filmmaker to play with cliches without ever falling back on them; the overall structure is carefully manipulative and we don't mind at all.,4/5
9722,Love Affair,Outstanding first version of An Affair to Remember. Superior on all counts.,5/5

9731,Love And Honor,"It's a lightweight drama filled with heavyweight war-is-hell monologues, delivered by a cast that lacks the gravity to sell them.",2/5
9732,Love & Mercy,"A warm, neat tribute to the Beach Boys mastermind.",3/5
9733,Love and Other Catastrophes,"All of these people are, of course, terminally cool about their sexuality. That's too bad, because a little uncertainty and doubt can make a great contribution to a comedy.",2.5/4
9734,Love and Saucers,"Unlike other documentaries that have an agenda... or that subtly coach their subjects to look or sound ridiculous, director Brad Abrahams simply allows David to tell his intimate, fascinating and incredible story.",8/10

9891,The Madness of King George,One of the unlikeliest but most likable movies of the 1990s.,5/5
9892,Madonna: Truth or Dare,"Although the movie seems happiest when it is retailing potential scandal, its heart is not in sex but in business, and the central value in the film is the work ethic.",3.5/4

10008,Maniac,"too good to be dismissed as simple exploitation, but also too inept in too many ways to be taken seriously",2/4
10009,Maniac,"One of the purest genre films of the decade. Honestly, be wary of Maniac. This film will do for walking home alone what Jaws did for the beach.",5/5
10010,Maniac Cop,"Gruesome, gory, and actually kinda fun.",2.5/5
10011,Manic,"Avoids the common pitfalls of the genre, instead giving us an intense character study supplemented by a supporting cast of characters, not vague stereotypes.",A-
10012,Manifesto,Confidently fulfils its ambitious intent with ease.,3.5/5
10013,Manito,A gritty look at one of Manhattan's more vibrant neighborhoods.,3/4
10014,The Manitou,Ack! There's an evil Indian demon growing on my neck!,1/5
10015,Mannequin 2: On the Move,Let's face it. This whole movie is based on stereotypes.,1/5
10016,Manny,"An informative, if largely deferent, biographical documentary that tritely explains the ascendancy of Filipino boxer Manny Pacquiao.",2/4
10017,"Manolo, The Boy Who Made Shoes For Lizards","Michael Roberts's documentary is an unabashed exercise in deifying its subject matter with superlatives and hyperbole from the mouths of talking heads, which ultimately results in the cheapening of the artist.",1/4
10018,Manos: The Hands of Fate,"Just as Citizen Kane is a textbook example of how to make a quality film, Manos: The Hands of Fate is exemplary in showing us, step-by-step, how to make a bad one.",1/5
10019,Man's Best Friend,"One of the sillier ""killer dog"" movies - and that's saying something.",2.5/5
10020,Man's Favorite Sport?,"Here Hawks moves a little slower, cribbing some of his own early jokes, but still dead funny.",4/5

10022,The Manson Family,This truly is one great-looking film whose like will never come our way again.,5/5
10023,Manson Family Vacation,"Manson Family Vacation proves Nick and Conrad are better when they are together and Davis wisely keeps their relationship at the center of the film, no matter what the two brothers encounter on their journey together.",B
10024,Man-Thing,As by-the-numbers as Bingo... A far bigger blow than anything Linda Lovelace could've bought to the table,1/5
10025,Manufactured Landscapes,"Though its vistas may look alien, this urgent, quietly damning film never lets us forget that we, by dint of our comfy environs, are their creators.",4/5
10026,Manufacturing Consent - Noam Chomsky and the Media,"A long, fascinating docu about the noted MIT professor and his lifelong work about propaganda in American society, or more specifically how the mass media set the agenda by selecting, distorting, framing--and also ignoring--major social issues.",A-
10027,Manuscripts Don't Burn,"The film observes rather than thrills, methodically demonstrating: this is how it happens. This tone and the even-keel direction avoid the trappings of a screed. It's actually a quiet but angry film.",2.5/4
10028,The Manxman,Filled with enchanting scenes and the story itself is quite well told.,3.5/5
10029,Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,Quaint and fairly lovable kiddie adventures.,4.5/5
10030,Mao's Last Dancer,"Well presented and brimming over with reverence, Beresford's tribute to an ex-Communist Billy Elliot sidesteps hard hits for a solid performance.",3/5
10031,Map of the Human Heart,"Despite its historical surrounding and a few stabs at thematic depth, Map of the Human Heart has all the flavor and plot complexity of a Harlequin romance.",2/4
10032,Mapplethorpe,"Smith's performance hints at tightly coiled depths that the movie skates by, and his character becomes easier to resent even when he begins to get sick.",D+
10033,Maps to the Stars,A gripping and exquisitely horrible movie about contemporary Hollywood - positively vivisectional in its sadism and scorn.,4/5
10034,Mara,"Smart plot, but leaden pacing deflates the frights right out of it.",2/4
10035,Marathon Man,"Marathon Man (1976) is a scary nightmare thriller, best known for the suspenseful pursuit scenes and a truly repellent scene of torture.",A
10036,Marathon: The Patriots Day Bombing,"It focuses, rightly so, on the survivors, still courageously trying to overcome their wounds - and on those who didn't survive, to whom the film is dedicated.",3/4
10037,Marat/Sade,"Told in rhyme and song, Marat/Sade entertains, informs, moves and horrifies in equal measure.",5/5
10038,Marauders,"What makes it watchable despite all the narrative hemming and hawing are the robberies themselves, which are vital and potent thanks to some inventive choices in execution.",B-
10039,Marc Maron: Too Real,"Too Real is passable time-filler - no matter that, halfway through you may be seized by the desire to switch off and listen to one of his podcasts instead.",3/5
10040,The Marc Pease Experience,Consider: A bad movie about cheesy a cappella and awful musical theater. What could be more excruciating?,1.5/4

10044,Marci X,"once-topical comedy that today feels like something out of the 'day-old' bin. It is not, however, the disaster its much-delayed release might indicate.",2.5/4
10045,Mardi Gras: Made in China,"Redmon is impressively hands-off, allowing the material to speak for itself about the headless beast of globalization.",3/4
10046,Marebito,What begins as a smart J-horror update of Blowup quickly turns into a sick joke.,2/4
10047,Marfa Girl,The film finds the actors' performance deficiencies functioning less as signs of authentic teenage behavior than as an incompetent carrier of plot.,2/4
10048,Margaret,"It's easy to see the years of frustration on screen in this plodding, overstuffed and fatally self-important coming of age story.",2/5
10049,Margin Call,"There have been better movies set in the financial world, but for a rather contained ensemble drama, it generally works, though it's no Inside Job",7/10
10050,Margot at the Wedding,"These people are so intensely unlikable, and the film so unwilling to help them toward any sort of redemption, that Margot becomes a sour and unrewarding experience.",C+
10051,Marguerite & Julien (Marguerite et Julien),"It finds its filmmaker completely lost between impulses to pay homage, play it safe, or offer something--anything--new.",1/4
10052,Maria Bamford: Old Baby,"Maria Bamford's unique ability to meld angst, annoyance, joy, and giddy good will into an exhilarating, buoyant whole is a miracle of its own, and it never gets boring.",A
10053,Maria By Callas,[A] respectful documentary. [Full review in Spanish],4/5
10054,Maria Full of Grace,"It's a 'good person in a bad situation' movie, and while the grim realities of life are dealt with dramatically and capably, it is not as inspiring as perhaps it means to be.",B
10055,Mariachi Gringo,"As the moving concluding scenes cement, ""Mariachi Gringo"" is right on pitch - and, happily, not simply as you'd expect.",3.5/5
10056,Marianne & Leonard: Words of Love,A powerful time capsule of longing and desire.,4/5
10057,Marie Curie: The Courage of Knowledge,"While the drama could have been more engrossing and substantive, the evocative period detail greatly enhances Noelle's selective and intimate portrait of a loving wife, mother and workaholic.",3/5

10059,Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School,Long on good intentions but short on believability.,C
10060,Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present,"As entertaining as the doc is, it never really measures up to the fascination and sheer force of personality of its subject.",2.5/4
10061,The Marine,"While The Marine's real-world connections to the War in Iraq are brief and incidental to its minimal plot, that fact doesn't make its reductive attitudes any more pleasant to swallow.",0.5/4
10062,Marinoni: The Fire in the Frame,"Montreal filmmaker Tony Girardin has a reluctant subject in 75-year-old master bicycle craftsman Giuseppe Marinoni, whose handmade bike frames are coveted by racers and serious riders alike.",2.5/4
10063,Mario,"Mario touches on these fears perfectly, not just for the main characters, but the entire ensemble. Uncertainness is universal, along with the pursuit of happiness.",3/5
10064,Marion Bridge,Small but beautifully acted drama.,3.5/5
10065,Marjoe,A portrait of interior disconnect between authentic faith and cynical disillusionment.,3/4
10066,Marjorie Prime,Fascinatingly explores the perception and dissolution of what we remember throughout our lives.,B
10067,Mark of the Devil,"The pic lacks the substance that made Michael Reeves' The Conqueror Worm a horror classic, as it too easily settles in to be solely a shocker torture-porn flick.",C+
10068,Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House,"The worst thing, though, is that there's already a masterpiece of a film telling this story from the other side, Alan J Pakula's All The President's Men.",2/5
10069,Marked for Death,"...rated R for violence, killing (lots of), profanity, nudity, bone crushing, bone bashing, and bone breaking. ...the whole thing is boneheaded.",5/10
10070,Marked Woman,Hard hitting Warner Bros. gangland drama with a dream cast.,4/5
10071,Marketa Lazarová,"Director Vlacil does not try to romanticize medieval knighthood but creates an atmosphere of mysticism and superstition, with excellent results.",4/4
10072,Marlene,"At once enigmatic, deliberately obfuscating in nature and extremely revealing.",4/5
10073,Marley,What results is an immensely detailed overview of Marley's life and times...,4/5
10074,Marley & Me,"The ads suggest a cute and innocuous dog comedy, but the film is actually a poignant, well-acted portrait of a marriage as it changes over time.",B
10075,Marlowe,A thoroughly enjoyable Philip Marlowe mystery.,A
10076,Marmaduke,"How bad is Marmaduke? Let's put it this way: Garfield, come home - all is forgiven.",1/5
10077,Marnie,"A critical and popular misfire upon its 1964 release, Marnie, smart and stylish, has since come into its own to be widely acknowledged as Hitchcock's final classic.",3.5/4
10078,Marooned,"Marooned isn't very interesting from a stylistic point of view, and the actors tend to get buried beneath the technology, but it does tell an exciting story.",3/4
10079,Die Marquise von O... (The Marquise of O),"This minor Rohmer may not have much to offer beyond the clarity of its perspective (and the soft beauty of Nestor Almendros's delicate cinematography), but its message will only grow more urgent in time.",3/5
10080,Marriage Italian Style,It's a scenario that's milked (literally) for every drop of amusement.,3/5
10081,Marriage Story,"The film never loses its sense of humour and absurdity. Somehow, in spite of the bleakness of the subject matter, it feels more redemptive than despairing.",4/5
10082,Married to It,"Married to It has its heart in the right place, and wants desperately to shed light and sympathy on the challenges of modern marriage, but the screenplay marches from scene to scene as if solving a jigsaw puzzle.",2/4
10083,Married to the Mob,"For fans of Demme's work, however, or those who are looking for comedy that's off the beaten path, Married to the Mob might fill the bill.",2.5/4
10084,Une femme mariée: Suite de fragments d'un film tourné en 1964 (A Married Woman),If Jean-Luc Godard isn't careful he is going to shoot his way right out of the avant-garde -- out of the idolatrous affection of all those cinema buffs who go for movies that are formless and obscure.,5/5
10085,Marrowbone,"In the end, all the creaky floorboards and crackly old-vinyl recordings of 1940s ballads in the world, can't obscure the fact that the most haunting things about ""Marrowbone"" are the ghosts of all the better movies it fleetingly resembles.",C
10086,The Marrying Man,"Your basic, everyday boy-meets-girl, boy-marries-girl, boy-divorces-girl, boy-marries-girl-again, boy-divorces-girl-again, boy well, you get the idea.",C
10087,Mars,"Low key, low budget and low energy, this animated space odyssey from the writer and director Geoff Marslett accompanies three mismatched astronauts to the red planet and the search for new life forms.",3/5
10088,Mars Attacks!,"Given its flimsy premise, this film comes off not too badly.",3/5
10089,Mars Needs Moms,"Visually arresting and emotionally rich, Mars Needs Moms is another animated triumph from a rejuvenated Disney Animation.",4/5
10090,Mars Needs Women,It was as bad as I thought it would be and I thoroughly enjoyed it.,C-
10091,Marshall,"It's not at all anomalous to see it on a theater screen. In fact, it's an extremely pleasurable anachronism from a movie era where theater audiences would often be expected to be serious-minded adults in search of hero stories.",3/4
10092,Marshland (La isla mínima),"""Heat and oppression hang in the air like an unspoken accusation.""",4/5
10093,Martha Marcy May Marlene,"One of the more impressive debuts we've seen in some time, a hypnotic and haunting film that pulls you into its story and keeps your attention while maintaining a steady intensity.",9/10
10094,Martian Child,A generic version of any other dramatic comedy about familial love.,2.5/5
10095,Martin & Orloff,"Even though this film swings for the fences but doesn't quite connect, Martin and Orloff is still a solid double off the wall.",3/5
10096,Martin Lawrence Live - Runteldat,The Spalding Gray equivalent of a teen gross-out comedy.,0.5/4
10097,Martyrs,You will either despise what you've experienced or support Pascal Laugier in creating a masterpiece that transcends the genre and leaves the viewer drained and breathless.,5/5
10098,Marvel's The Avengers,A joyous blend of heroism and humour that raises the stakes even as it maintains a firm grip on what makes the individual heroes tick.,4/5
10099,Marvin's Room,"What begins as an apparently simple tale of sibling interaction reveals a complex web of pain, guilt, and uncertainty.",3.5/4
10100,Marwencol,"Marwencol shows a process of self-imagining and storytelling that reflects the intricate ways that we all understand ourselves, the worlds inside and around us.",10/10
10101,Mary Pickford: The Muse of the Movies,"If you are interested in Pickford herself or just in the early history of the Hollywood film industry, this is an enthralling documentary.",7/10
10102,Mary,"Mary comes to feel as if lacks a through line, collapsing into a series of disconnected horror-movie beats.",1.5/4
10103,Mary and The Witch's Flower,"A whimsical, winsome world of invention, gorgeously translated on screen by the animation team.",A-
10104,Mary Magdalene,"Mary Magdalene only snaps into focus as narrative when we get to Jerusalem, chiefly because it gives these kids something to physically rail against - moneylenders, Judas kisses, Romans, and all. It's a little on the late side, though.",B-
10105,Mary Poppins,"Disney had done a magnificent job of adapting the PL Travers character to the screen, using cinematic effects to the full in creating an enchanting story.",4/5
10106,Mary Queen of Scots,Rourke's greatest achievement is the performances she's coaxed out of her two lead actresses. They're so good they're like De Niro and Pacino in Heat.,4/5
10107,Mary Reilly,"As a study of repression, Mary Reilly has some great moments, but it seems director Stephen Frears was aiming for intense and brooding, and boring is what he got.",2/5
10108,Mary Shelley,"It's somewhat amusing - especially Tom Sturridge, who turns Lord Byron into poetry's version of Jack Sparrow - but immediately forgettable.",2/4
10109,Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,"The Creature is on target, but the rest of the film is so frantic, so manic, it doesn't pause to be sure its effects are registered.",2.5/4

10114,The Mask of Zorro,"In an age ruled by action films reliant on post-production effects, the barebones approach of an old fashioned swashbuckler is rather refreshing.",3/4
10115,Masked and Anonymous,Masked and Anonymous' greatest asset and its greatest shortcoming are one in the same: Bob Dylan.,2/5
10116,Masquerade,"As predictable as these stories invariably are, Lee's wonderful turn reignites the potent fantasy of peasant wisdom - if given the power - melting politically cynical hearts and legislating through decency rather than fear.",3/5
10117,Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World,"Finally, an adventure film for grownups",4/5
10118,Master of Dark Shadows,"It is a fun film, which moves quickly and has new information some fans might not even know. But it makes its point: Dan Curtis did a lot more than horror, even if he was instrumental in shaping it on TV.",3.5/5
10119,The Master of Disguise,"Non-stop, bad slapstick ... When it can't think anything else to do, the script falls back on those old reliables, flatulence jokes and pratfalls.",1.5/4
10120,Master Z: Ip Man Legacy,Master Z is undoubtedly a feast for martial arts movie lovers.,3.5/5

10122,Masterminds,"Galifianakis and Sudeikis give this their all, but truthfully, the REAL heist was funnier than ""The Hollywood Version.""",2/4
10123,Masters of the Universe,I'm not saying He-Man deserved all that brilliant of a movie ... but this thing's a freaking disaster.,1/5
10124,Masters of the Universe 2: Cyborg,"Few genres amuse me more than post-apocalyptic fantasies about supermen fighting for survival. Cyborg is one of the funniest examples of this category, which crosses Escape from New York with The Road Warrior but cheats on the budget.",1/4
10125,Matador,"If you're in the mood for an edgy, stylish piece of erotica, then ""Matador"" should leave you panting for more.",3/4
10126,Match,Patrick Stewart's performance is practically an argument for Belber to jettison everything else and take the actor on the road as a one-man spoken-word act.,2.5/4
10127,Match Point,Allen brilliantly uses subversive humor to heighten the impact of those themes and bring home the importance of dumb luck.,4/5
10128,Matchstick Men,"There's a solid emotional resonance ... In many ways, this is Scott's best film yet.",3.5/5
10129,Mateo,An uplifting testament to the notion that it's still possible for a sinner to find his true calling and turn his life around after first paying his debt to society.,3/4

10150,Max Manus: Man of War,"It's lively, sturdily mounted, just ever so slightly jejune.",3/5
10151,Max Payne,It's a one-dimensional detective noir rather than an exciting shoot-em-up.,C-
10152,Max Reload and the Nether Blasters,"Max Reload isn't for everyone, but it's not trying to be. It's a pizza-and-soda Saturday night gamer film for serious gamers - not the kind that just grind through bug releases, but can name a developer other than Hideo Kojima.",2/5
10153,Max Steel,Even bored adolescent boys are unlikely to muster any enthusiasm for this chintzy reboot of the hybrid hero.,D-

10164,Maytime,"Maytime (1937) is a beautiful, enchanting classic romantic musical from the 1930s. It is the third Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy operetta and often considered the best of their eight pairings.",A

10169,McCabe & Mrs. Miller,"McCabe and Mrs. Miller is like no other Western ever made, and with it, Robert Altman earns his place as one of the best contemporary directors.",4/4
10170,McCanick,"A tight little police story with a compelling if slightly overwrought twist, McCanick is well executed fun, and an appropriate showcase for Morse's great talents.",B

10234,Memoirs of a Geisha,"This schmaltzy adaptation, a throwback to Hollywood of yesteryear in its simplistic sensibility, is like taking a visual anthropology course, ""Geisha 101,"" that imparts the most basic facts about a geisha's life.",C
10235,Memoirs of an Invisible Man,"This material is intriguing enough that I wish there had been more of it. Comedy consists of the application of logic to the absurd, and there are many more opportunities here than the screenplay takes advantage of.",2.5/4

10254,Mendy: A Question of Faith,"It's not just Ivan Sandomire's broken English that's richly detailed, but his really intense body language, which suggests a small creature trying to find its sea legs.",2.5/4
10255,Mental,"...due to a mortifyingly miscalculated lead performance and haphazard writing, Mental is often as funny as a burning orphanage.",2/5
10256,Menú degustació (Tasting Menu),"A polite, if insubstantial, film-watching experience.",3/5
10257,The Mephisto Waltz,You get the notion that the people who made the film didn't take magic seriously enough. I don't mean they should believe in it; but they should have made a film that pretended to.,2/4
10258,Red & White (Merah Putih),Sub-standard battle scenes and ropey characterisation drain this powerful story of its impact. Less history than histrionic.,2/5

10270,"Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence","An interesting venture, a bit slow at times.",3/5
10271,The Merry Gentleman,"A deliberately-paced crime drama that brings a strange sense of warmth, dark humor, and even some odd romance to a potentially dreary tale.",3.5/5
10272,Meru,"The reason to watch, and to watch on as big a screen as possible, is the footage of the breathtaking climbing action.",3.5/4

10277,The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc,A great movie that doesn't know when to quit,2.5/4
10278,Metallica: Some Kind of Monster,"Because of its unexpected level of intimacy, it will likely hold the interest of even those with no interest in heavy metal bands.",63/100
10279,Metallica Through the Never,I actually forgot I was watching a movie at some points and wanted to applaud in between songs.,8/10

10285,M.F.A.,"While it may not be a ""feel good"" experience by any means, M.F.A. is a genuinely necessary film that takes on an important issue and explores the many-faceted emotions and responses to rape with a great sense of nuance and emotional centeredness.",4/5
10286,MFKZ,"For every silly or sexist misstep, there's always a Shakespeare-quoting gangster round the next corner to slap a grin right back on your face. Mutafukaz is bound to be the coolest animation you'll see this year.",8/10
10287,MI-5 (Spooks: The Greater Good),"For fans after a nostalgic hit from a beloved TV show of yesteryear this will hit the mark, for the rest it could be a case of spy movie burnout.",3/5

10292,Miami Connection,The most incredible 25 year old film you'll see in theaters this year.,B+

10298,Michael Che Matters,"While not consistently fresh (bits on giving money to the homeless and Jesus being white feel familiar) or laugh-a-minute hysterical, the special is intriguing in its demand for more honesty.",B-
10299,Michael Clayton,"Modeled after character-driven paranoia-conspiracy dramas of the 1970s, Michael Clayton represents the intelligent directing debut by writer Tony Gilroy, elevated a notch or two by George Clooney's star performance.",B+
10300,Michael Collins,"Collins, who died at 31, was arguably the key figure in the struggles that led to the separation of Ireland and Britain. He was also, on the basis of this film, a man able to use violence without becoming intoxicated by it.",3/4
10301,Michael Jackson's This Is It,"Even without the glitzy appeal of Jackson, there's a story about artistic collaboration in there that's worth seeing.",4.5/5
10302,Michelle Wolf: Joke Show,"More than anything, Joke Show reminds us that the personal is political... so Wolf doesn't need to recount the week's events from behind a desk to deliver a message.",B+
10303,Mickey Blue Eyes,the goods are a day late and a dollar short -- how apropos of the film itself.,1.5/4

10318,Midnight Express,Midnight Express walks a fine line between portraying Hayes as a victim or a criminal.,85/100
10319,Midnight Family,"Despite partaking in a cut-throat system that dehumanizes the concept of caretaking, what makes this particular family a representative picture of their profession is their inherent humanity.",4/5
10320,Midnight in Paris,Woody Allen's latest venture takes him into new territory and moving locations has inspired him to deliver one of his strongest premises in years.,8/10
10321,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,An intriguing and handsome production.,3/4
10322,Midnight Return: The Story of Billy Hayes and Turkey,"...fascinating documentary about the making and veracity of Midnight Express, a film that supposedly told the true story of Billy Hayes...in this documentary we meet the real Billy Hayes, and it's starkly different from the movie.",8/10
10323,Midnight Run,"Whoever cast De Niro and Grodin must have had a sixth sense for the chemistry they would have; they work together so smoothly, and with such an evident sense of fun, that even their silences are intriguing.",3.5/4
10324,Midnight Special,"If the search was on, or necessary, to find the next Steven Spielberg, it may be too soon to call it decided... [but] might it be Jeff Nichols?",4/5

10329,A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy,A poor second fiddle to stuff like Porky's.,2/5
10330,Midway,"If the movie drags a bit in the dramatics department, that's probably because the filmmakers were shooting for 'accuracy' over 'emotion'.",78/100
10331,Mifune: The Last Samurai,The moments in which Okazaki reflects on Mifune's choices through the actor's own experiences are the best parts of the film.,B-

10336,A Mighty Heart,"As Mariane, wife of slain jounralist Daniel Pearl, Angelina Jolie renders admirably understated performance, but Winterbottom's political drama is too safe and middlebrow, unable to decide what it is about and whose side of the story it is telling.",B-
10337,Mighty Oak,"Tommy Regan's soulfulness and enthusiasm brings the audience to joyful tears, despite the weak script. McNamara lets each actor shine but it is Janel Parrish's heartfelt performance that will inspire many to run home to hug their loved ones.",6

10340,A Mighty Wind,"Folk music numbs me. But the sheer exuberance of A Mighty Wind, directed with mirth and mischief by Christopher Guest, who devised the story with Eugene Levy and let the cast improv the rest, had me begging for more.",3.5/4
10341,Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates,A surprisingly fun summer comedy and icing on the (wedding) cake for fans of the raunchiest of humor.,4/5
10342,Mike Birbiglia: Thank God for Jokes,"With a craftsman this assured, we could definitely thank God for jokes in general, or we could cut out the middleman by just thanking Birbiglia for the jokes he chooses to tell.",9.2/10
10343,Mike Birbiglia: The New One,"[Mike] Birbiglia's latest Netflix special is candid and never saccharine, which oddly makes it all the more heartwarming.",8.10/10
10344,Mikey and Nicky,"As talky as it is, you might think Cassavetes himself directed it. Mainly for fans of that type of thing, but compelling enough for the neophyte.",3/5

10352,Military Wives,"There's nothing here you won't have seen before or can't see coming but still, Military Wives is a film that's hard to entirely resist, like a song that you'll hum along to even if you forget the tune straight after.",3/5
10353,Milk,"As the first openly gay politico, Sean Penn gives a towering, ultra-sympathetic Oscar-caliber performance (his best since Mystic River), elevating Van Sant's biopic way above its conventional narrative and melodramatic trappings.",B+

10366,The Last Mimzy,"Once or twice a year, I just go nuts about a movie. It's all I think about. It occupies my mind because I'm so delighted with it. I imagine that I detect references to its themes everywhere I go. This is that movie for 2007.",3.5/4

10385,Mirai,By melding impressively designed fantasy and reality together there's always something surprising around the corner in this Japanese anime.,4/5
10386,Miral,The strength and importance of Miral lies in its vantage point. Schnabel is offering viewers a perspective on the Middle East that they are unlikely to have seen before in other mainstream movies.,3/5

10389,Mirror Mirror,"While Mr. Singh knows how to make performers and sets look good, he has trouble putting them into vibrant, kinetic, meaningful play, which effectively means that he's a better window dresser than a movie director.",2.5/5
10390,MirrorMask,Hats off to superlative artists Neil Gaiman & Dave McKean for constructing something this endearingly odd and utterly enjoyable.,5/5

10401,Miss Arizona,"""Miss Arizona"" alternates, not altogether gracefully, from heavy, tear-jerking moments to slapstick comedy, sometimes within the same sequence.",2.5/4
10402,Miss Bala,"An always violent, often surreal ride through the thickets of widespread corruption, with the audience sometimes left as confused and disoriented as the poor girl.",3/4
10403,Miss Bala,"It's as if the film has boiled down every post-2000s action thriller into its own particularly unseasoned, overcooked and tasteless dish.",1/4
10404,Miss Congeniality,Sandra Bullock still has that winning smile but little else. Someone should give this misguided star/producer some sound career advice.,3/10
10405,Miss Congeniality 2 - Armed and Fabulous,"Bullock struts her stuff well, but this comedy lacks freshness and sags in all the wrong places.",2/5
10406,Miss Fisher and the Crypt of Tears,You feel as if you're being treated to a series of jokes by someone who's forgotten all the punchlines. The gags are there but they never realise their potential. And the can-do spirit does wax and wane.,3/5
10407,Miss Julie,"Ullmann's version of ""Miss Julie"" exists in a special cinematic category; it's toxic, it's hypnotic, and passionately translates Strindberg's genius instinct for enlightening the multi-layered psychological spectrums of human desire for lust and power.",B+
10408,Miss Juneteenth,Miss Juneteenth is a beautiful story of family as well as an inspiring one of hope. You'll love it for its authenticity and also in Channing Godfrey Peoples' ability to tell a story and create captivating and compelling characters.,8.5/10
10409,Miss Meadows,"Perhaps Karen Leigh Hopkins's intent was to subtly suggest the surreal aspects of the story, but ultimately she underplays her hand.",2/4

10419,Mission: Impossible,"A mission gone awry, prompting you to hope that reruns of its television incarnation will pop up on cable soon.",2.5/5
10420,Mission: Impossible 2,This flick has little intrigue to tie it to its namesake and it comes off more like a very expensive John Woo spoof.,2/4
10421,Mission: Impossible III,"Injecting fresh blood and energy into the franchise via stronger plot, more suitable villain (terrifically played by Philip Seymour Hoffman), and larger ensemble, TV's Abrams makes a splashy debut proving he's just as gifted big-screen director.",3/4

10425,Mission of Honor,"A niche film for World War II buffs, Polish patriots and air display patrons. Not exactly subtle, but few war films are - and it's hard not to get caught up in fighting these old battles.",3/5
10426,Mission Park,"If real F.B.I. agents were as inept as those in ""Mission Park,"" their average on-the-job life span would approximate that of a very lucky mayfly. And if actual drug honchos were as careless as the ones presented here, we wouldn't need the F.B.I.",1.5/5
10427,Mission to Mars,"An exceptionally tasteful and erudite popcorn spectacle, thanks in large part to a great cast and to director De Palma, who is in top form.",3/4
10428,Missionary,"Slick, sordid, generic, and as it comes apart it flirts with some pretty serious Mormon bashing, for good measure.",1.5/4
10429,Mississippi Burning,"""Mississippi Burning"" feels like a movie made from the inside out, a movie that knows the ways and people of its small Southern city so intimately that, having seen it, I know the place I'd go for a cup of coffee and the place I'd steer clear from.",4/4

10434,Mistress,"The performances are all strong (particularly Landau's) but, as a whole, the movie suffers from competing impulses that push and pull Mistress from comedy to drama and back again.",2.5/5
10435,Mixed Nuts,"A typical sight gag is people rollerbladding down the street carrying a Christmas tree between them. An irritated boyfriend then runs into them and knocks the tree over. Boy, that one sure put me in stitches.",0.5/4
10436,Mo' Better Blues,"There's no getting around Lee's talent, but in this case his script could have used some polish -- or perhaps collaboration.",3/4
10437,Mo' Money,"Damon Wayans wrote Mo' Money as a star vehicle for himself and is credited as an executive producer. So, so it's safe to say he deserves the blame.",2/4
10438,Moana,"Its cultural setting is fresh; its storytelling, less so. It navigates the reefs but it doesn't discover a whole new world.",3/5

10440,Mobile Homes,"Poots gives it her best shot, playing Ali as a woman who's spent far too long staying one step ahead of the consequences she knows are coming, but there's nothing to Mobile Homes that merits the effort.",2/5
10441,Mobsters,There isn't a moment when you simply sit back and share in an actor's joy at revealing himself through his role.,D
10442,The Mod Squad,I suspect this trio of actors -- more an Odd Squad than a Mod Squad -- will someday look back on this film as a forgettable footnote in hopefully more substantial careers.,3/10
10443,Model Shop,A brilliant bitter-sweet understated look at life in America during the Viet Nam War.,A
10444,Modern Life (Profils paysans: la vie moderne),"Though visually seductive, especially for anyone longing to escape the urban jungle, Modern Life is also to be admired for refusing to slide into postcard lyricism.",3/5
10445,Modern Life Is Rubbish,"Gill's debut offers nothing but incessant needle-drops instead of drama; modern life may be rubbish, but there's no need for modern romances to be so utterly naff.",2/5
10446,Modern Romance,There's little to nothing funny about this.,1/5
10447,Modern Times,Chaplin's sentimental but keenly satirical swipe at the mechanization of everyday life is by consensus the last of the great silent features.,5/5
10448,Modigliani,"...devoid of emotional resonance, despite a full-bodied performance by Andy Garcia.",2/4
10449,Moebius,"Kim treats his bloody and provocative taboo breaking with a much lighter touch this time around, and the result, while still deeply flawed, is mostly a sly dark comedy that doubles as a very impressive display of wordless storytelling.",B-
10450,Mogambo,Pointless remake of Red Dust squeaks by on star power.,3/5
10451,Mohawk,"Mohawk is a dark, oppressive tale with little in the way of levity, but Geoghegan has crafted an impressive period yarn which acts as a barbed indictment of colonialism, wrapped up in a crowd-pleasing display of splatter and gore.",4/5
10452,Mojados: Through the Night,"Unflinchingly real and never glamorous, the film presents a harrowing picture of these lives in a way rarely seen.",5/5
10453,Mojave,"...Mojave isn't only missing substance, it's missing any good reason to care to watch.",4/10
10454,Mojin: The Lost Legend,Wuershan's style has an energy and exuberance that pulls together all the disparate elements.,3/5
10455,Molly,89 minutes of Shue's strained Acting display is 89 more than anyone should ever have to endure.,1/4
10456,The Molly Maguires,"Realism without much reality, enormous care for the wrong details, historical accuracy and spineless dramaturgy.",2/5
10457,Molly's Game,"What Sorkin's writing can't gloss over is his lack of experience behind the camera, and it's what makes ""Molly's Game"" a mostly good movie instead of a great one.",B
10458,Molokai: The Story of Father Damien,"I am glad I saw it, even if I was not entertained.",B-
10459,Mom and Dad,It's just incredibly fun to watch Nicolas Cage destroy a pool table with a sledgehammer while he sings the Hokey Pokey.,8/10
10460,Mom and Dad Save the World,"Too many canine-faced munchkins and Lovitz-Garr shenanigans do not a comedy make, folks.",0/5
10461,Mom and Me,[Wardrop] chooses his own emotional environment and he explores it with admirable sensitivity and humour. Worth the admission price for the pets alone.,4/5
10462,Moments of Clarity,"The plot is rather generic and familiar but there are moments good humor and, yes, clarity.",6/10
10463,Momentum,"Decent, if modest, DTV-level actioner. Well-paced and directed.",6/10
10464,Momentum Generation,"Surfing is a craft (a sport? a lifeway?) that has generated a lot of mediocre film over the years. Momentum Generation is something unusual in all that: It's genuine, and genuinely interesting.",8/10
10465,Mommie Dearest,Horror's got nothing on Faye Dunaway.,3.5/5
10466,Mommy,"It's an uproariously emotional movie, to all appearances painfully personal and featuring performances which are almost operatic in scale.",4/5
10467,Mommy Dead and Dearest,Director Erin Lee Carr has an incredible ability to answer the questions as they arise to the viewer.,3/4
10468,Moms' Night Out,A timely testament to motherhood that just might make the perfect Mother's Day gift.,3/4
10469,Mon Oncle,"A hard-edged satire that is both funny and beautiful, entertaining and thought-provoking.",4/4
10470,Mona Lisa,"In an era when movies about love almost always invariably devolve into formulaic affairs, Neil Jordan's Mona Lisa stands out as an often-surprising, multi-layered achievement.",4/4
10471,Mona Lisa Smile,So heartwarming that it makes Patch Adams look gritty and raw.,2/5
10472,Monday Night Mayhem,"Now here's a film that reads fairly ho-hum, but once it's final credits have rolled you'll agree you've just watched one of the more stimulating and interesting telemovies of recent times",3.5/5
10473,Mondays in the Sun (Los Lunes al sol),"Throughout, Bardem ... is a potent presence.",3/5
10474,Mondo Cane,The quintessential mondo film.,5/5
10475,Money Buys Happiness,"Neither too surreal nor too self-involved, the film leavens its obvious symbolism with quirky digressions and a sharp appreciation of all the troublesome details of a troubled marriage.",3/5
10476,Money Monster,"Unfolding like Dog Day Afternoon meets The Big Short, the film attempts to hold the Wall Street elite accountable ... but operates more successfully when simply looking to entertain.",3/5
10477,The Money Pit,A movie that contains one funny scene and 91 minutes of running time to kill.,1/4
10478,Money Plane,"There are rare moments when Money Plane is as over-the-top as we'd like it to be, but the premise is never capitalized on as it should be.",1.5/5
10479,Money Talks,"Tucker has a personal triumph. He's funny in that cocky, freefall way that Carrey and Jerry Lewis get away with: He's floating on inspiration and improvisation, like a musician.",3/4

10481,Moneyball,Those who enter the cinema unstirred by either the sport or by the joys of stats are unlikely to come out converts.,2/5
10482,Mongol,"Arguably Bodrov's biggest, most accomplished film, Mongol is everything that Oliver Stone's Alexander was not: sumputuously mounted, beautifully acted, and illuminating in historical yet accessible terms the tumultuous life of the legendary warrior.",A-
10483,Summer With Monika (Sommaren med Monika),"Thanks to international distributors sensationalizing its sexual frankness, this bittersweet drama of ill-fated first love helped establish Ingmar Bergman as a filmmaker.",3.5/4
10484,Monk With a Camera,"Too frequently, Monk With A Camera feels like a character study with no interest in studying its character.",2/5
10485,Monkey Shines: An Experiment in Fear,George Romero should stick to zombies.,2/4
10486,Monkey Trouble,"A quirky, bright, PG-rated adventure that's as entertaining as Free Willy. Better, maybe, since monkeys are a lot more charismatic than whales. This is a splendid family film.",3/4
10487,Monkeybone,"A very bad movie, and amazingly so.",1/4
10488,Monogamy,"Framed as a relationship-on-the-skids drama, Monogamy is instead a shallow and unconvincing look at male psychosexual pathology.",1/4
10489,Monsieur Lazhar,Algerian Fellag plays the title role with an obvious love for young minds finding their place in the world.,4/5
10490,Monsieur Verdoux,"This later entry from Charlie Chaplin is a bit talky, but it's also eerily amusing and a lot darker than we often associate with ""The Little Tramp.""",4/5
10491,Monsoon Wedding,Sabrina Dhawan's screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog.,7/10
10492,Monster,"This unsettling drama, with Theron's character immersion, may not thrive at the boxoffice but it's done with enough integrity to merit a supportive audience.",3.5/5
10493,Monster Camp: The Story of NERO Seattle,"Wonderfully wacky! ... Never poking fun at the people, the movie, nevertheless, is hilarious.",3/4
10494,Monster Family,"Adults are better off rewatching Hotel Transylvania (2012) or The Incredibles (2004), whose dysfunctional families are more human than this one.",2/5
10495,Monster House,"This is a great fantasy story, the kind of movie kids dream about in their back yards.",4/5
10496,Monster Hunt (Zhuo Yao Ji),Tone and plot are all over the place and none of the characters -- monster or otherwise -- have enough depth to make you care about them.,2.5/5
10497,Monster-in-Law,The movie might have been better served had it simply tossed out the Lopez character and given us more of Fonda.,2.5/5
10498,Monster Party,"Pretty effective and rather fun, if you have the stomach for this sort of thing.",3.5/5
10499,Monster Road,A documentary that doesn't always seem to be sure what it's documenting.,2/5
10500,The Monster Squad,unbridled fun for every kid who ever daydreamed about kicking monster ass.,3.5/5
10501,The Monster That Challenged the World,An enjoyable but poorly made monster film that should satisfy those whose expectations are low.,C+
10502,Monster Trucks,"It has tentacles and hot wheels, yes, but not the legs or bright ideas to sustain itself.",2/5
10503,Monsters,"If this is what the British director can achieve on a shoestring, one can only look forward to what a bigger budget may bring with monster expectation.",3.5/5
10504,Monsters and Men,"...hard-hitting as a call for more understanding, and failing that, more activism.",3.5/5
10505,Monster's Ball,"In Marc Foster's cure-the-hate melodrama, chocolate love goes a long way in soothing frayed white-black relations.",1/4
10506,Monsters: Dark Continent,"A frustrating, disappointing follow-up to Gareth Edwards' left-field, low-budget game-changer, that's more Battle: Los Angeles than Aliens. And who left the aliens out?",5.5/10
10507,"Monsters, Inc.",Popcorn-tastic fun for kids and adults,4/5
10508,Monsters University,Monsters University is proof that prequels can be done right.,4/5
10509,Monsters vs. Aliens,"This is a typical DreamWorks animation (to be seen in 3D): light, playful, self-reflexive with nostalgic view of 50s sci-fi and horror, in which the freshness is not so much in ideas as in the actors and voices, dominated by sexy and shapely Witherspoon.",B
10510,Monstrous,Don't you hate when Bigfoot movies forget they're Bigfoot movies?,1.5/5
10511,Monte Carlo,"Happiness in Monte Carlo is just a scream, a whistle, or a dimmer switch away.",2/4

10513,Monterey Pop,an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies,4/5
10514,A Month by the Lake,"A Month by the Lake is a sly romantic comedy about a collision of sex, ego, will and pride, all peeping out from beneath great thick layers of British reticence.",3.5/4

10519,Moon,"If there's still an audience for old-school, ideas-driven allegorical science fiction, it will undoubtedly find much to cheer for and perhaps a bit to laugh at in first-time director Duncan Jones' ambitious if slightly uneven debut Moon.",3.5/5
10520,Moon over Parador,"Dreyfuss is good, too, but too human, and lacking in the wicked edge that might have put the movie over the top.",2/4
10521,Moonlight,The story's power comes from the gaps between words - and an ongoing battle to find the right ones.,A
10522,Moonlight and Valentino,"Moonlight and Valentino is a Hallmark sympathy card of a film, pretty to look at with a message that's sincere. Yet it's hard to take its pretentious platitudes of grief and recovery too personally.",2/4
10523,Moonlight Mile,"Moonlight Mile feels authentic--in its grief, its hope, its eradicable sorrow and its outreach for happiness in the face of despair.",3.5/5
10524,Moonrise,"Superb, moody Frank Bozage drama.",5/5
10525,Moonrise Kingdom,A worthy addition to Anderson's canon -- his deadpan wit meshes nicely with a generous view of human imperfections.,4/5
10526,Moonstruck,"Reviews of the movie tend to make it sound like a madcap ethnic comedy, and that it is. But there is something more here, a certain bittersweet yearning that comes across as ineffably romantic, and a certain magical quality.",4/4

10535,Morgan,Morgan's makers lose trust in the intellectual heft of their material and chose to prioritize empty sensation instead.,2/4

10537,Morning Glory,"A sharp and endearing take on the workplace comedy, anchored by veteran Roger Michell's sure-handed direction and a luminous lead performance from Rachel McAdams.",4/5
10538,Morning,"As an exercise in grief, Orser's drama is affecting, exhausting and something of a shortcut ...",2/5
10539,The Morning After,"It would be a mistake, however, to dismiss this movie just because the plot is so shaky. I think it's worth considering because of the performances. Fonda and Bridges are wonderful in the film.",3/4
10540,Morning Light,"For those of us attuned to the punched-up presentation of The Amazing Race and Survivor, built week by week to maximize human drama and suspense, Morning Light is just reality lite.",2/4

10543,Mortal Kombat: Annihilation,"It's just an excuse for a series of tedious, repetitious fight scenes that have been staged with no hint whatsoever of originality.",0.5/4
10544,Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge,"... the R-rated Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion's Revenge offers a perspective previously unexamined in Mortal Kombat lore and all the bloody mayhem that will delight old fans, yet is approachable enough to lure in new ones.",4/5
10545,Mortal Thoughts,"There is another level to Mortal Thoughts than either the guilt or innocence of the characters, or the wit with which Rudolph portrays their world. It is the level on which ordinary people cut themselves loose from ordinary morality.",3/4

10553,Most Beautiful Island,"A short, stressful, and utterly spellbinding debut that transforms the immigrant experience into the stuff of an early Polanski psychodrama, Ana Asensio's Most Beautiful Island is a worthy winner of the SXSW Grand Jury Prize for best narrative feature.",B+
10554,The Most Dangerous Game,"A mindless action movie, but there's nothing inherently wrong with that.",3/4

10560,Mosul,[E]mbedded Iraqi journalist Ali Maula acts as our guide and his musings on the situation in his homeland give this film an editorial and contextual anchor that will help viewers less familiar with the day-to-day socio-politics of Iraq.,3.5/5

10566,"Mother, May I Sleep with Danger?","The movie is much ado about nothing, feeling desperately thin and pointless. At first promising campy fun, it's soon simply mystifying, then misguided, gross and finally tiresome in its look-at-me-ness.",D
10567,Mother Night,"Does the film work? Not really. It loses itself in comic caricatures of the loonies that Campbell meets in New York; and its melodramatic double-reverses, by making the plot seem arbitrary, rob it of importance.",2.5/4

10571,Mothers and Daughters,"This is the type of criss-crossing, female-centric project filmmaker Rodrigo Garcia excelled with in ""Mother and Child"" and ""Nine Lives,"" but director Paul Duddridge doesn't seem to have a clue how to tell a story or create visual interest.",D

10598,Mr. & Mrs. Smith,Kinsberg's highly tuned comedic dialogue pulls the film out of the fire by keeping the blistering husband and wife conflict chugging.,3.5/5
10599,Mr. Arkadin,A fascinating Wellesian mess,4/5

10605,Mr. Deeds,The second tier performances in Mr. Deeds are worth the price of admission.,7.5/10
10606,Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,"Here is a shamelessly simple story with a populist point of view, but it is handled with such charm and charisma and acted so well by Cooper and Arthur that it became another Frank Capra classic.",5/5
10607,Mr. Destiny,"The movie is a slow march through foregone conclusions, and its curious passivity is underscored, if that is the word, by the quietest soundtrack I can remember.",2/4

10618,Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium,"Gifted writer Helm (Stranger Than Fiction) makes a disappointing directing debut in a fantasy-fable that's occasionally charming but doesn't quite come to life as a truly magical fare, perhaps due to the high standards set by Tim Burton and company.",C-

10620,Mr. Mom,"Sit-com material, ably done, with Keaton's off-kilter delivery a highlight.",3/5
10621,Mr. Nanny,"The plot in Mr. Nanny is flimsy, mostly tenuous excuses for making Hogan kiss a doll or sing a lullaby or dress in purple leotards and pink tutu while whomping on the bad guys.",0/5

10628,Mr. Right,Kendrick and Rockwell are so utterly in their wheelhouses that their daffy line readings and simpatico physicality create a kind of delirious super-chemistry.,4/5
10629,Mr. Saturday Night,"It's a very personal project; [Crystal] not only stars, but co-wrote the screenplay and makes his directing debut. This is like an autobiography of how he might have turned out.",3/4
10630,Mr. Skeffington,This is a star vehicle in extremis.,2/4
10631,Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"While Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is the most moral of films, it is so artfully filled with real emotion that it never becomes heavy-handed.",5/5

10635,Mr. Woodcock,"While often both funny and perceptive, it's less than memorable, and a weak ending reduces it to more of a time-filler than a movie that's truly worthwhile.",69/100
10636,Mr. Wrong,"Pullman, who can usually shade a character so subtly between sweetie and sucker, is made to veer manically into jerkhood for no particular reason except that the filmmakers couldn't come up with anything smarter to propel this galumphing caper along.",C-
10637,Mrs. Brown,"Even as the film teases us with the underlying ''sensuality'' of the relationship, it fails to portray it as a convincing human bond. Mrs. Brown is stately yet depressed, like Victoria.",C+

10639,Mrs. Doubtfire,"Raw, uncoated stupidity that sticks in your throat.",1/5

10644,Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont,Too often confuses gooey sentimentality for legit compassion.,2/4
10645,Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (Mrs. Parker and the Round Table),"Leigh's performance, at the center of almost every scene, shows us a woman in a world of men, who wore it as a badge of honor that she could outdrink and outtalk them.",3.5/4
10646,Mrs. Serial Killer,"Nothing, not Jacqueline Fernandez in her perfectly coiffed curls, nor Mohit Raina trying very hard to appear as if he knows what's going on, nor the sundry others who come and go, help.",0/5

10653,Mugabe and the White African,"Shot more like a thriller, this powerful documentary follows a white Zimbabwean family as they take on one of the most ruthless dictators in human history. It's both riveting and wrenching, and needs to be seen as far and wide as possible.",4.5/5

10665,Mumford,A likable semi-screwball comedy.,3.5/5
10666,Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary,"A reverential biopic that wisely leaves the damning evidence on the back burner in favor of focusing on everything about Mumia Abu-Jamal except what exactly transpired at the corner of 13th and Locust in the wee hours of December 9, 1981.",4/4

10674,Munich,This is easily Spielberg's best film since Saving Private Ryan.,4.5/5
10675,Munyurangabo,"There's a patient attentiveness and inquisitiveness to Munyurangabo. that seemingly springs, at least in part, from the cultural divide between Korean-American filmmaker Lee Isaac Chung and his native Rwandan cast, milieu, and language.",3.5/4
10676,The Muppet Christmas Carol,"Like all the Muppet movies, this one is a musical, with original songs by Paul Williams (my favorite is the early chain-rattling duet by the Marley brothers). It could have done with a few more songs than it has.",3/4

10742,My Brother The Devil,Original drama portrays siblings caught between traditional values and a life of crime.,4/5
10743,"My Country, My Country","Regardless of on which side of the fence viewers stand, this documentary will reverberate.",3.5/5
10744,My Cousin Rachel,"Weisz nearly vibrates with tremulous emotion, and the British countryside - full of romping wolfhounds, droning vicars and ancient family retainers - feels like yet another old and welcome character in this old-fashioned yet modern Gothic.",3/4
10745,My Cousin Vinny,"This is a film that gets better as it goes along, but not enough better to make much of a difference.",2/4
10746,My Darling Clementine,My Darling Clementine must be one of the sweetest and most good-hearted of all Westerns.,4/4
10747,My Date With Drew,"It is all pretty harmless fly-on-the-wall fun, if a little too disposable.",6/10
10748,My Days of Mercy,"The movie doesn't buckle under the weight of its ambitions, and in straining to find the light it ends up engaging and compelling - even if it is overly complex.",B-
10749,My Dead Boyfriend,The laughs are scattered in this comedy which finds a lot of 40something actors playing New York caricatures of their much-younger selves.,1.5/4
10750,My Dinner with André,A couple of New York intellectuals get together for dinner and have a confessional chat about their life. Wallace Shawn and Andre Gregory play themselves.,B

10752,My Dog Skip,Refreshing in its honest simplicity.,8/10
10753,My Entire High School Sinking Into the Sea,Combining a disaster movie with a high school comedy while also animating it is a rather ambitious combination. What's even more incredible is just how well it all works.,4/5

10760,My Favorite Season (Ma saison préférée),"One of those intriguing films that functions without a plot, and uses instead an intense curiosity about its characters.",3/4
10761,My Favorite Wife,It's easy to see why Leo McCarey opted out of this tepid romantic comedy.,3/5
10762,My Favorite Year,...an affectionate look back on those golden years of live TV...a delightful little romp.,7/10

10764,My First Mister,"It's full of emotion, but it's honest emotion, and it's tempered with good humor.",A-
10765,My First Wedding,"The narrative impetus of the film is stupidity, as Laurent Firode's romantic comedy only manages to progress from plot point A to B thanks to the witlessness of its unbelievably naive protagonists.",1/4
10766,My 5 Wives,...unlikely the film will win over non-Dangerfield fans.,1/4
10767,My Flesh and Blood,"The footage of these children isn't always pleasant to watch, but it's my feelings toward the family that really started to bother me.",4/5
10768,My Friend Dahmer,"As an examination of a notorious American killer, it may be in over its head. But as one of something just as notorious-American high school life-it's fun, sinister, and remarkably thoughtful.",3.5/5
10769,My Friend Flicka,Shows its age while offering up a sort of illusory nostalgia born and bred almost entirely within the cinema experience.,2/4
10770,My Giant,"It's interesting the way Muresan, in real life a center for the NBA's Washington Wizards, establishes himself on screen as a stable area of calm, while the plot scurries around him.",2/4

10772,My Hindu Friend (Meu amigo Hindu),"Dafoe certainly dedicates himself to the material and the shadowy cinematography from Mauro Pinheiro Jr emphasises every cheek and bone hollow of its sick central character, but the project as a whole is too self-absorbed to be absorbing for anyone else.",2/5
10773,My Italian Secret: The Forgotten Heroes,"An important, emotionally engrossing and well-edited documentary about the true heroes of Italy during WWII.",8.8/10
10774,My Journey Through French Cinema (Voyage À Travers Le Cinéma Français),Bertrand Tavernier's exquisite documentary consistently avoids mere hagiography by looking to the films themselves.,3/4
10775,My Joy,The unsettling mood -- many scenes have a documentary verisimilitude that heightens the threat of random violence -- keeps us off-balance but riveted.,3/5
10776,My Kid Could Paint That,I love a documentary that doles out both sides of an interesting story and then forces you to decide for yourself where the truth actually lies.,4.5/5
10777,My Last Five Girlfriends,Some very different cinematic methods and above-average acting and direction make this entourage of beautiful people a rom-com worth watching.,7/10
10778,My Left Foot,"My Left Foot is a great film for many reasons, but the most important is that it gives us such a complete picture of this man's life.",4/4

10780,My Life as a Dog (Mitt Liv som Hund),An affecting and authentic portrayal of a young boy's attempt to understand the adult world.,4/5
10781,My Life as a Zucchini (Ma vie de courgette),Barras has bravely tackled an almost taboo subject and made it palatable and manageable for children and adults alike.,4/5
10782,My Life Directed By Nicolas Winding Refn,"My Life Directed is mostly disposable, just the sort of home-movie project a restless artist might sketch while stuck in a hotel room for a few months.",2.5/5
10783,My Life in Ruins,"What you wind up with is a comedy in ruins with the one exception of Richard Dreyfus, who plays a widowed jokester with such class and warmth, you can almost start liking American tourists again. Almost.",3/10
10784,My Life So Far,Should appeal to audiences tired of the summer's flashier fare.,2/4
10785,My Life's In Turnaround,"My Life's in Turnaround details the misguided yet strangely sincere journey of these two filmmakers as they each struggle to find their movie, a direction, and a girlfriend.",3.5/5

10790,Le Château de Ma Mère (My Mother's Castle),"It is likely that no one, not even Pagnol, had a childhood quite this perfect, and yet all happy childhoods grow happier in memory, and it is the nature of film that we can share some of Pagnol's happiness.",4/4
10791,My Name Is Joe (Mein Name ist Joe),"Loach's keen eye for unpolished reality and Mullan's passionate, well-modulated turn keep the film well worth watching.",3/4
10792,My Name Is Khan,"Karan Johar's film is a message picture, and like many in that genre it runs overly long as it assiduously works to make its point.",2.5/5
10793,My Name is Myeisha,"My Name is Myeisha doesn't pull any punches, and isn't afraid to remind members of the audience that the issues depicted in this film are not universal.",B
10794,My Name Is Nobody (Il mio nome è Nessuno),"La.rgely successful with some gaping flaws, and deeply experimental in a way that verges on upsetting",6/10
10795,My Neighbor Totoro,My Neighbor Totoro is more than a fairy tale; it is an engaging story which uses fantasy sparingly.,88/100
10796,My Neighbors the Yamadas,charming,3.5/5

10803,"My Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done",An unusually unwatchable effort from filmmaker Werner Herzog...,1/4
10804,My Son the Fanatic,"Om Puri's performance is based on the substantial strength of his physical presence, and on his clear-sighted view of his world as an exile.",3.5/4
10805,My Stepmother Is an Alien,"What we have here is a goofy comic performance by Kim Basinger, weighed down by a turgid script and a decision to use Dan Aykroyd mostly as a straight man. Too bad.",2/4
10806,My Sucky Teen Romance,"The movie didn't quite do it for me, but I'd like to see what Hagins could do with a better cast and budget.",2.5/4
10807,My Summer of Love,A startling rite-of-passage drama from Polish-born writer-helmer Pawel Pawlikowski.,4/5
10808,My Super Ex-Girlfriend,"Reitman, comedy maestro of 1970s and 1980s, has clearly lost his touch, for this picture is even less funny and even more out of synch with the comedy genre, Hollywood, and the zeitgeist than his previous effort, Evolution.",D
10809,My Uncle Rafael,"""My Uncle Rafael"" elicits plenty of goofy chuckles even as it regularly threatens to fly off the rails.",3/5
10810,My Way,"The big-budget South Korean film is a mash-up of Chariots of Fire and Saving Private Ryan linked together with pounding orchestral swells. The film too often gets stuck in a shooter video game groove upon entering Spielberg domain, however.",2/4
10811,My Way,"The paeans about national pride and brotherhood may be regional, but constant slow-motion battle scenes and squishy sentimentality are strictly wanna-be Tinseltown.",2/5
10812,My Week with Marilyn,[VIDEO] Williams's magical transformation into Marilyn Monroe is uncanny; you never question it for a moment.,A-
10813,My Worst Nightmare,...a terminally uneven piece of work that will leave most viewers flummoxed and frustrated.,1.5/4
10814,Mysteries of Lisbon,"Operatic and droll, Mysteries of Lisbon wears its period compositions and magisterial length (four-and-a-half hours, edited from a six-hour miniseries) lightly.",3.5/4
10815,The Mysteries of Pittsburgh,I can automatically assume that the characters are a lot more multi-dimensional in Chabon's book -- because in the movie they're pretty much a bunch of paper-doll cutouts,2/5
10816,Mysteries Of The Jesus Prayer,"A documentary that presents a long-needed overview of Eastern spirituality in our time with its emphasis on prayer, silence, and living icons.",4/5
10817,Mysterious Skin,...the whole thing just feels flat somehow.,2/4
10818,"Mystery, Alaska","This latest hockey opus is standard polar fare, Picket Fences on ice, so to speak.",1.5/4
10819,Mystery Men,It simply just isn't all that funny.,2/4
10820,Mystery Road,"Cormac McCarthy is yet to set one of his sparse, existential tales in the Australian outback, and he may never need to now Ivan Sen has picked up the burden with Mystery Road.",3.5/5
10821,Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie,"It doesn't take much imagination to poke fun at the pitiful special effects, goofy '50s he-man behavior and unintentionally hilarious script, but the silliness of the entire concept eventually wears down your defenses.",2.5/4
10822,Mystic Pizza,"""Mystic Pizza"" does create the feeling of a small resort town and the people who live there and, amazingly, given the familiar nature of a lot of the material, it nearly always keeps us interested.",3.5/4
10823,Mystic River,A movie of startling power and intimacy.,4/4
10824,The Myth Of The American Sleepover,The film's restraint and reliance on non-professional actors ends up creating something that often feels stilted and unintentionally absurd rather than naturalistic.,2.5/5
10825,Nabbeun namja (Bad Guy),"Although the set-up strains the audience's disbelief, the mournful style -- complete with a downbeat soundtrack reminiscent of triphop crooners Portishead -- and meandering pace give this tale an unusual, near surreal, edge.",3/5
10826,Nacho Libre,Nacho's processed cheese and tortilla-thin premise are purely a refried conduit for Black... [it] would be inexcusably trashy if it weren't for the naïve sincerity of its star.,2/4
10827,Nadine,"I didn't laugh very much in this movie. There were a couple of genuinely funny moments, but they didn't build and the movie didn't redeem itself by making me very interested in the characters.",2.5/4
10828,Nail in the Coffin: The Fall and Rise of Vampiro,Director Michael Paszt's film goes behind the curtain of the professional wrestling industry to peek in at the very personal story of one man Ian Richard Hodgkinson and his lifelong involvement in the sport.,3.5/5
10829,Nails,"Altogether it's a simple, but relatively satisfying, horror film.",5/10
10830,Naked,The film besmirches the reasons that Groundhog Day's Möbius-strip construction worked.,1.5/4
10831,Naked Ambition: An R Rated Look at an X Rated Industry,"[Director Michael] Grecco comes across as a naive, wide-eyed kid in Wonderland, which might be sweet if it wasn't so obvious his real motivation is to make the audience feel good about buying his book.",2.5/5
10832,Naked Boys Singing,"Alternately silly and shocking, yet ultimately moving, this raunchy musical revue cleverly reveals the vulnerability of ubiquitous nudity as a window to the human soul.",3.5/4
10833,Naked Fame,Entertaining but lightweight documentary.,B-
10834,The Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear,"Nielsen's secret is that he does almost nothing, and certainly nothing he seems to think is funny.",3/4
10835,The Naked Jungle,A wonderfully strange jungle melodrama.,B
10836,The Naked Man,Gets too strange and cartoonish for its own good.,1/4
10837,The Naked Prey,Has one of the better unending chase scenes for its day.,4/5
10838,The Naked Spur,"One of Stewart's best tortured performances, showing his dark side. A must-see for Stewart buffs.",3/5
10839,The Namesake,"The cast as a whole excels, in fact, and the sumptuous cinematography by Frederick Elmes helps rescue a movie that should have been better than it is.",2.5/5
10840,Nancy Drew,It's an utter embarrassment that this movie should even carry the Nancy Drew name.,C-
10841,Nancy Drew and the Hidden Staircase,The Hidden Staircase ultimately fails to introduce the younger members of its audience to the pleasures of movie detective.,C+
10842,Nanking,"While at times the film begins to feel like a laundry list of bad deeds, the first-person accounts pack a wallop.",3.5/5
10843,The Nanny Diaries,"The culture clash, or rather class crash that ensues as middle and upper mix uncertainly is far more insightful and, dare I say it, humane, that the usual take on such things.",3/5
10844,Nanny McPhee,"This whimsical and wonderfully nasty children's tale is thoroughly enjoyable, if not hugely notable.",3.5/5
10845,Nanny McPhee Returns,"Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang is an emotionally engaging, pleasingly old-fashioned fantasy drama with a strong script and terrific performances. Highly recommended.",4/5

10847,Napoleon Dynamite,Imagine an out-there cartoon and watching it spring to live-action on the big screen.,3.5/4
10848,Nappily Ever After,Nappily Ever After is a story that we may have seen before in one form or another - but is still one worth retelling in its own way.,3.5/5

10853,Narcissister Organ Player,"Narratively, the mask stays on.",1/5
10854,Narco Cultura,"Fascinating, bizarre, and beautifully shot, but if I have one criticism, it's that I feel like I left with more questions than answers. Maybe it's the material, maybe it's the messenger, probably it's both. Either way, it's a must-watch.",B
10855,Narcopolis,"Despite the surface sheen, and some enterprising plot twists, it doesn't entirely convince.",2/5
10856,Nas: Time Is Illmatic,"Time Is Illmatic is comprehensive, even wisely holistic, but still feels as though something is missing;",B-
10857,NASCAR: The IMAX Experience,Surprisingly earnest and sedate...the sort of perfunctorily informative instructional film that might be the first leg on a guided tour of a NASCAR museum.,C
10858,Nashville,"This film is like no other I have ever seen for one major reason: it plays exactly, and I mean exactly like real life.",4/4
10859,Nasty Baby,There aren't a ton of significant moments as it essentially rolls along and follows their journey to find out if Polly can get pregnant.,6.5/10
10860,Das Schreckliche Mädchen (The Nasty Girl),"It's the film's style that I object to. The story itself is fascinating, but the style seems to add another tone, a level of irony that is somehow confusing.",2.5/4

10862,Nate & Margaret,"Here is a sweet, delicate story about friendship.",3/4

10866,National Lampoon's Animal House,It serves its purpose by entertaining us.,7/10
10867,National Lampoon's Blackball,"English audiences will thoroughly enjoy the cruel humour, culture-based hilarity and in-joke casting; everyone else will wonder why the film was made at all.",3/5
10868,National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation,"Christmas Vacation never quite reaches the levels of suburban-angst rage that other Vacation movies do, but it does have its moments.",6/10
10869,National Lampoon's European Vacation,"It's a sophomoric and predictable little farce - but fans of the old-fashioned Chevy Chase (you know, the funny one) will find much to enjoy.",72/100
10870,Homo Erectus (National Lampoon's The Stoned Age),"Thanks to natural selection, without the script, direction or comedic chops to survive, Homo Erectus will be extinct from theaters soon enough.",1.5/5
10871,National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1,"It's hard to satirize a satire. That's what ""National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1"" wants to do, but the target proves elusive. This is a would-be comedy that's not as funny (nor as satirical) as the movies that inspired it.",1/4
10872,National Lampoon's Movie Madness,"Leave this one as history has intended: unknown, forgotten, and detested by the unfortunate few who've actually seen it.",1/5
10873,National Lampoon's Senior Trip,Having 'National Lampoon' on your film doesn't guarantee it's quality.,2/5
10874,National Lampoon's Vacation,"Oh, is this a guilty pleasure. It's also the first R rated movie featuring nudity that I was allowed to see at the theater, which may have something to do with my fond memories of the picture.",4/5

10889,Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (Kaze no tani no Naushika),It's a delight.,5/5
10890,Tell No One (Ne le Dis à Personne),Tell No One retains all the slick dynamism and tension of a classic Hollywood thriller without ever seeming anything but French.,4/5
10891,Ne Te Retourne Pas (Don't Look Back),"There are two wonderful performances to savor here, but the film itself doesn't hold much of a lasting impact despite a convincing parade of hysteria.",B-
10892,Ne Zha,"Conventionally animated but paced with kinetic glee, Ne Zha crams in a plethora of contemporary and pop culture references, and in those moments it's at its least fun and most obvious.",3/5
10893,Nebraska,"Really, Nebraska is a small-scale quixotic adventure about the importance of dreams, no matter how pie-eyed, in which the outlined flaws could all be forgiven, if it just went somewhere a bit more surprising.",B-
10894,Necessary Roughness,"Avoid it because it's the sort of soporific clich-fest in which every player gets exactly one measly trait, and the suspense about who's going to win the big game registers at absolute zero.",D
10895,Neds,"The humour and emotion are so sharp you might not feel them at the time, but Mullan's film cuts deep and leaves its mark.",5/5

10903,Nell,"Nell is an effective film, and a moving one. That is largely because of the strange beauty of Jodie Foster's performance as Nell, and the warmth of the performance by Liam Neeson, as a doctor who finds himself somehow responsible for her.",3/4
10904,Nemesis,"The hyperactive pace, the imaginative (if not always polished) effects and especially the formidable action scenes certainly make this worth a peek, more so after midnight with pizza and beer in hand.",2.5/4

10921,Never Die Alone,"Never Die Alone discards logic and reason for a farcically overblown orgy of uninhibited sex, drugs and gaudy materialism.",2.5/4
10922,Never Grow Old,"Gritty archetypal Western that benefits from solid performances by Hirsch and Cusack and damp, grey Irish locations",2.5/4
10923,Never Let Me Go,The movie works beautifully even if you know what's coming and knowing it makes the film's strangely beautiful early scenes even more poignant.,3.5/4
10924,Never Rarely Sometimes Always,What an extraordinary film this is.,A
10925,Never Say Never Again,The film's photography is pretty slick and the stuff in the Bahamas in particular has aged very well.,3.5/5

10930,New Police Story (San ging chaat goo si),"Chan se sai muito bem em um papel mais dramtico do que de costume, mas, embora as seqncias de ao sejam eficazes, o filme  longo demais e acaba perdendo o ritmo em vrios momentos.",3/5
10931,New Port South,Goes nowhere.,2.5/5
10932,New York City Serenade,"Prinze's limited range as an actor drags down a spirited performance by Klein, but the script is too awful to give either of them much hope.",1/5
10933,The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking,"Slightly entertaining, in a really stupid way.",2/5
10934,New Best Friend,"...plays like a badly edited, 91-minute trailer (and) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going. In fact, it doesn't even seem like she tried.",1.5/4
10935,The New Daughter,"Feels a bit like a made-for-cable thriller that borrows liberally from similar flicks, but is still perfectly watchable on a dull Wednesday night.",3/5
10936,New Guy,An intriguing black comedy of the Office Space genre that rapidly descends into a Kafkaesque thriller.,2.5/4
10937,New In Town,"Like the odious stepchild of Fargo, New in Town gleefully offers up citizens of rural, snowbound New Ulm, Minnesota as a collection of funny-speaking, Jesus-loving, tapioca-making misfits deserving of nothing less than outright mockery.",0/4
10938,New Jack City,The filmmakers pull out the stops to get their message across.,3.5/5
10939,New Jersey Drive,The movie is expert on how cars are stolen (it takes about 10 seconds). It is also expert on how a smart and essentially prudent kid ends up inside a lot of stolen cars and gets into a lot of trouble.,3/4
10940,A New Kind of Love,"men are from Mars, women are from Venus, and writer-director Melville Shavelson is from Neptune",2/5

10942,A New Life,"Alda's purpose is to show us fairly typical people going through fairly typical things. They live, we watch. On that voyeuristic level, the movie works.",3/4

10944,New Money,New Money serves as an excellent reminder of where desperation can lead if we let it get the better of us.,9/10
10945,The New Twenty,Chris Mason Johnson's ensemble drama could've been just another earnest time capsule about friends in their late twenties; what saves it from devolving into mere mumblecore is a broader-than-average outlook.,4/6

10952,New York Stories,"The best news, of course, is that Allen is back in rare form.",3.5/4
10953,Newcastle,"A well meaning but ineffective coming-of-age story set on the surfing beaches of the industrial mining center of Newcastle, Australia. Mediocre action footage and tedious angst make for a film that is an effort to watch.",5/10
10954,Newly Single,"A powerful piece of work, as darkly hilarious as it is bleak.",4/5
10955,Newlyweds,"Newlyweds is funny, but never at the expense of its ideas. Whereas most relationship comedies these days are contrived and dopey, this one strives to be more truthful, and it succeeds. A solid, insightful human comedy.",3/4
10956,Newlyweeds,"Going neither in the direction of Reefer Madness nor a Cheech and Chong movie, it's both funny and serious, and its depictions of pot-smoking could be read as either promotional or cautionary.",2.5/4
10957,Newness,"The most sexually charged film he's made yet, Doremus shoots it with energy to match, delivering intimacy while suggesting voyeurism.",3.5/5
10958,Newsies,"Although the material does indeed involve young protagonists, no effort is made to show their lives in a way today's kids can identify with. This movie must seem as odd to them as a foreign film.",1.5/4
10959,The Newton Boys,More yawn-inducing than fifty people yawning.,2/10

10962,The Next Best Thing,Madonna still cannot act.,2/4

10964,Next Friday,"If there were any justice, Next Friday would be the last Friday. Somehow, I fear the first weekend grosses will make that unlikely.",0.5/4

10966,Next Goal Wins,"Next Goal Wins could stand to go deeper into game strategy, or local customs and living conditions, or any number of personal stories, but the victories it does achieve are enormously satisfying.",3/5
10967,The Next Karate Kid,"The film does have a few warm moments and is at its best when simply developing the relationship between Miyagi and Julie. But, as you might expect, those moments are few and far between and overshadowed by all the ludicrous plotting.",1.5/4
10968,Next Stop Wonderland,Wonderland is a rather sugary romance film that is as subtle as a ton of Domino sugar cubes falling on top of you.,C-
10969,The Next Three Days,The Next Three Days refuses to puff up its action with message-movie sermonizing.,2.5/4

10971,Niagara,The real star in this film is the majestic and powerful Niagara Falls...,B+
10972,Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,"A surprisingly timeless story given its hip trappings. It will enthrall teen viewers who imagine such an adventurous, music-fueled life for themselves.",3.5/5
10973,Nick of Time,The most preposterous movie in theaters isn't the Ace Ventura sequel (or even Money Train) but this wanna-be nail-biter.,1.5/4
10974,Nickelodeon,"As an homage to the start of the film industry, this extravaganza is quite a tribute, but as a motion picture it's sadly lacking.",2/4
10975,Nicky's Family,"The story is good enough to tell itself, and the filmmakers should have let it.",3/5
10976,Nicotina,The smoke that powers the film's narrative is a whole lot of hot air.,2/4
10977,Night Across the Street,"Across the film's second half, as is sometimes his wont, Ruiz begins to cast aside the genteel, tradition-of-quality trappings misleadingly suggested by the first act and indulges in the lurid fancy of pulp fiction and horror.",3/4
10978,Nuit et Brouillard (Night and Fog),"Every time I see another film that references the Holocaust, my mind instantly flashes back to this remarkable documentary",A
10979,Night at the Golden Eagle,Rifkin's references are ... impeccable throughout.,2.5/5

10981,Night at the Museum 2: Battle of the Smithsonian,This is a bigger and better night out than the first.,3/5
10982,Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,"It's breezy, big-hearted, fitfully amusing and mildly educational. If this is your ten-year-old's movie franchise of choice, you're probably on to a good thing.",3/5
10983,A Night at the Roxbury,If only the movie's writers (there were half a dozen) and directors (there were two -- one bailed after two weeks) had created a movie one-fourth as funny as this sketch was.,1.5/4
10984,Night Catches Us,The star power of natural movie stars Anthony Mackie and Kerry Washington lights up and keeps afloat Tanya Hamilton's Night Catches Us,2.5/4
10985,Night Comes On,"Night Comes On will stick with you long after turning it off, yearning for more female-driven stories like this one and hoping they become just as poignant as other films to broader audiences.",4/5
10986,Night Crossing,It manages to extract an enormous amount of suspense from the final half hour.,8/10
10987,Night Falls on Manhattan,Its maker's best since 1988's Running on Empty and maybe even '82's The Verdict.,3.5/4
10988,Night Hunter (Nomis),"Whatever coherence the players saw on the screenplay page was lost on the way to the set, and from the set to the editing bay",1.5/4
10989,A Night in Casablanca,"Penultimate Marx Bros. film suffers by comparison with their glory days, but still worth a look.",4/5
10990,Night Moves,A seminal modern noir work from the 1970s about an innocent and lost soul making his way among liars and thieves...,A-

10993,Night of the Demons,"Practically dripping with the blood, sweat and tears of those who set out to make a genuinely good party movie",3/4
10994,Night of the Demons,"90 minutes of thirtysomethings playing teens, lesbian Elvira wannabes and Edward Furlong splattered with latex gore.",3/5
10995,The Night of the Generals,Quirky character study in Nazi evil.,B-
10996,The Night of the Hunter,"A unique, terrifying masterpiece.",5/5
10997,The Night of the Iguana,Noteworthy for Burton's acerbic performance and Ava's seen-it-all portrayal of an earthy lady.,B
10998,Night of the Lepus,"It is this technical laziness as much as the stupid story or the dumb direction that leaves the film in limbo and places it in neither one camp nor the other - neither with Attack of the 50-Foot Woman nor with Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail.",1/5
10999,Night of the Living Dead,A film that confuses screaming with emotion.,1/4
11000,Night of the Living Deb,"Funny, smart and sweet, with a great character at its centre, Night Of The Living Deb is a rom-zom-com that we can heartily recommend.",4/5
11001,Die Nacht der lebenden Loser (Night of the Living Dorks),...unable to elicit either scares or laughs from the viewer...,2/4
11002,La Notte di San Lorenzo (Night of the Shooting Stars) (The Night of San Lorenzo),"...not enough to sustain our interest through a 105-minute movie, despite the obvious earnestness with which the brothers have imbued the story.",1.5/4
11003,Night on Earth,"Night on Earth dawdles a bit, and a couple of the segments, notably the one in Helsinki, feel like half-baked epiphanies. Throughout, though, there are moments that catch you delightfully off guard.",B
11004,Il portiere di notte (The Night Porter),This undignified film couldn't quite get past all the sleaze it dredged up.,C
11005,Night School,"Night School is a dim-witted, slapstick comedy that runs painfully long. A supporting cast of great comedians saves the film from being a total loss.",2/5
11006,Night Shift,"Dated comedy offers very little in the chuckle department, with even less in narrative obstruction, but remains interesting only for the early work of now-famed director Ron Howard.",4/10
11007,Night Sweats,An intriguing but cut-rate thriller that (unfortunately) looks it.,1.5/4
11008,Night Tide,"Strange, moody, but effective.",3/5

11010,Night Watch,"Elizabeth Taylor, and about time, has got herself a good picture and a whodunit at that",3.5/5
11011,Night Watch,The preponderance of elaborate mumbo jumbo becomes an unbearable drag.,1.5/4
11012,Night Will Fall,"The footage - discoveries made by the Allies in the liberated Nazi camps during 1945 - is graphic, terrible, unforgettable.",4/5
11013,Nightbreed,"Although Barker knows a good, eerie setting when he sees one, he can't seem to do anything with it.",5/10
11014,The Nightcomers,"Michael Winner's film ends where James's tale begins, and it is a deflating attempt to flesh out that which was never meant to be fleshed out, describing in sordid detail the love affair between the mistress and the groundskeeper and how it affected the t",3/5
11015,Nightcrawler,"Deeply philosophical while remaining both captivating and entertaining, Nightcrawler is that rare breed of worm, one with an Art Film heart and a Hollywood shine...Easily one of this year's best films.",A
11016,Nightingale,"Nightingale is first an intellectualized puzzle, and a portrait of a man losing his mind a very distant second.",1.5/4
11017,Nightlight,"The Blair Witch Project has inspired dozens of imitations and knock-offs, but perhaps none so close to the source -- and yet so uninspired -- as NIGHTLIGHT.",1/5
11018,The Nightmare Before Christmas,This is an amazing looking film.,A
11019,Nightmare Cinema,The final two are so good and so strong I ended up walking away feeling good about the whole thing... Just maybe go get some popcorn when Father Benedict shows up.,3/5
11020,Incubo sulla città contaminata (Nightmare City) (Invasion by the Atomic Zombies),"The movie is piled high with cheese, but makes for a tasty guilty pleasure.",6/10
11021,Nightmare Man,"A solid, whirlwind of a horror movie, with more twists and turns than a hula hoop competition.",4.5/5
11022,A Nightmare on Elm Street,Still stands on its own as an intriguing and chilling example of how horror works best when the characters and the audience don't have to be lobotomized.,3.5/4
11023,A Nightmare on Elm Street,"In a way, Freddy finally makes sense in this version of Elm Street, but Robert Englund's original Freddy is still preferable to Haley's pervy Groundskeeper Willy.",1.5/4
11024,Nightmares,"Nothing spoils a horror story faster than a stupid victim. And Nightmares, an anthology of four supposedly scary episodes, has plenty of those.",2/5
11025,"Nightmares in Red, White and Blue",It delivers a film school semester's worth of knowledge in 1 tight & thoroughly entertaining feature and goes a long way toward validating horror as a respectable film genre.,4.5/5
11026,Nights in Rodanthe,"Marking Richard Gere and Diane Lane's third teaming, Wolfe's romantic drama lacks style and distinction, but takes advantage of the stars' maturity and their chemistry.",C+
11027,Nights of Cabiria (Le Notti di Cabiria),"I'll go with the painfully obvious: people who already expect to love it probably will, but even those who have no expectations at all may be pleasantly surprised by its enduring resonance underneath the annoying period tics.",3/4
11028,Nijinsky,... this unorthodox documentary works for those who have a sensitivity to the artist and to his struggles against such a cold and indifferent world.,A
11029,Nim's Island,Think of it as a safari tour for toddlers -- perfectly safe but without any of the legitimate thrills found in a real adventure.,1.5/4

11038,The Ninth Gate,Painful to watch The Ninth Gate's meticulous tone and rhythms go for naught in its final half-hour.,6/10
11039,Nitro Circus: The Movie 3D,[VIDEO ESSAY]...an eye-popping celebration of a talented and fearless stunt crew unafraid to put their lives on the line. Taste the adrenaline babyface.,B+
11040,Nixon,"It's overwhelming to see the many sides of Richard Nixon brought together with this kind of epic force. More than just biography, Nixon is a dizzying and cathartic spectacle -- a free fall through 50 years of American political imagination.",A

11042,No,A fascinating exercise in historical fill-in-the-blanks.,B
11043,No Alternative,Dickerson seamlessly blends a coming-of-age tragedy with the transitioning music scene of the mid '90's and a push for awareness of the stigma around mental illness.,8/10
11044,No Clue,"If [Butt] could make the serious bits feel bigger, as opposed to just windrow dressing to his jokes, he'd have a parody worth really taking seriously.",2.5/4
11045,No Country for Old Men,"Brilliant from first frame to last, this faithful adaptation of McCarthy's novel is the Coen brothers best film to date, a masterpiece that's mesmerizing as a thriller and meditation on the nature of violence in America.",A
11046,No End in Sight,"The film is methodically edited, interspersing tales from the ground with policy wonks, decisions with consequences, until it paints the administration into a corner.",4/5
11047,No Escape,No Escape is insanely intense. Is it credible? Who cares. This movie is full of heart-pounding action that takes your breath away. From start to finish it is just plain fun.,3/5

11053,No Holds Barred,As cartoonish as its star.,2/5
11054,No Manches Frida,No Manches Frida tries wildly to delight but goes nowhere. It is the cinematic equivalent to the cringeworthy class clown at the back of the room that everyone ignores. It's just embarrassing.,1/5

11061,No One Lives,"'No One Lives' is generic ""shock"" cinema that was a result of 'Hostel,' which is why it feels like it sets horror back 10 years.",1.5/5
11062,"No Pay, Nudity","No Pay, Nudity is very much like filmed theater, and it might actually work better as a play. As light drama, the movie is fairly inert.",2/5

11070,No Such Thing,"The script kicks in, and Mr. Hartley's distended pace and foot-dragging rhythms follow.",2/5
11071,No Tears For The Dead,Several dim-witted moments make it difficult to appreciate the movie's finer points - specifically the appealing cast and some grizzly action directed with verve and panache.,3/5
11072,No Turning Back,Nebot's passionate work as an actor in particular glues the film together.,B-
11073,No Way to Treat a Lady,"A thoroughly enjoyable film about a pitiless serial killer of middle-aged women, that is played for laughs at the expense of the women victims.",B+
11074,Noah,"By turning the monolithic odyssey into a sword-and-sandals showdown with occasionally cosmic tangents, the 137-minute studio venture contains the glimmers of a truly visionary achievement flooded by half-baked ideas.",C
11075,Noah's Arc: Jumping the Broom,"Despite some drinking (with nary a hangover afterward) and a fling or two, the prevailing mood isn(TM)t campy or disco-decadent. Rather the emphasis is squarely on heartfelt communication, monogamy and child rearing.",3/5
11076,Nobelity,"My advice would be to find a copy of this fantastic documentary, settle down for an 80-minute piece of enlightenment, and then maybe use its lessons to help make the world a better place.",4.5/5
11077,Noble,"O'Kane is alright in a film that's solid rather than spectacular, but Sarah Greene is quite exceptional as the 20-something Noble, and seems bound for bigger things.",3/5

11081,Nocturnal Animals,"Tom Ford's ""Nocturnal Animals"" is a feast for the eyes and a fun-size Mars Bar for the brain. It's also highly enjoyable, when it's not trying to be serious and make heavy points about the interrelation of art and life.",B

11089,Nomad,"A throwback to yeteryear's epics, Kazakhstan's official entry for the Foreign-Language Oscar is an old-fashioned actioner using real locales and extras rather than CGI effects; lack of unified vision may derive from too many directors behind the camera",C

11098,Normal Life,"[Normal Life] is the new movie by John McNaughton, famous for Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. It's not as unremittingly painful as the earlier film, but just as fascinating in its portrait of criminal pathology.",3.5/4

11129,Not One Less,"Despite the obvious cultural differences, this is old-fashioned, no-frills moviemaking that harkens back to the days when directors were more concerned with telling a real story than blowing things up or appeasing big-name stars.",3.5/4

11152,November Criminals,The film advances that old Hollywood trope: Blacks can't get justice unless whites are willing to get it for them.,2/4
11153,Novitiate,"Novitiate captures something many religious people can understand: the idea that beating oneself (both figuratively and, sometimes, literally) as an act of devotion will make God love us more than he loves other people.",3.5/5

11161,Now You See Me 2,...arrestingly entertaining from beginning to end...,16/20
11162,Nowhere Boy,Nowhere Boy has just about enough music and biographical detail to appeal to Lennon and Beatles fans but it's far more intimate than the typical rock star biopic.,4/5
11163,Nowhere to Hide,"It's funny, cool, exhilirating, eye-popping, fun.",B
11164,Nuclear Nation,"For the most part, the movie takes an eye-level approach to the disaster, focusing on the experiences of ordinary people living in makeshift shelters and public housing, lining up for food, and returning to their homes in hazmat suits.",B
11165,Number Seventeen (Number 17),Highly entertaining but practically incomprehensible.,2.5/5
11166,Number 37 (Nommer 37),Number 37 is an impressive début which suggests good things to come from this promising young director.,3.5/5

11172,Ny Export: Opus Jazz,"Embraces the notion of dancers as characters with histories, more than just beautifully coordinated fleshly parts.",3/4

11179,The Object of Beauty,"By the end of the film, the plot has been worked out to everyone's satisfaction, but the plot isn't really that important. What is important is the ways that people love one another.",3.5/4
11180,The Object of My Affection,Director paces movie too languidly and dulls most of the emotional punches with the result being a film bordering too often on blandness when its strength is its risk taking.,2.5/4
11181,Objectified,"A documentary that could have been more involving to people outside design careers if director Hustwit edited out some of the long, tedious monologues in favor of showing more products with exciting designs.",C+
11182,Oblivion,"Oblivion goes on for a long time, moving slowly and self-consciously, and it looks like a very expensive movie project that has been written and rewritten many times over.",2/5

11190,Ocean's Eleven,Soderbergh is so cool he can make anything go down like fine wine.,3/4
11191,Ocean's Thirteen,"More than the previous segments, in this one, director Soderbergh and his writers adopt the prevalent paradigm of Howard Hawks, centering the saga on male camaraderie, cool professionalism, and above all group loyalty.",B
11192,Ocean's Twelve,Pleasantness and affability reign supreme in Steven Soderbergh's sequel to the remake of Ocean's Eleven.,3/4
11193,The Octagon,"It's ambitious work but not always successful, with director Eric Karson biting off a little more than he can chew when it comes time to build momentum with such a top-heavy film.",B-
11194,October Baby,"An apolitical, pro-life parable apt to touch the hearts of audience members on either side of the abortion issue.",3.5/4
11195,October Country,One understands how Donal Mosher could obtain access to this moments or stark honesty and bleak truth. One wonders what the family thought of the film when they saw it.,3/4
11196,October Gale,The film begins as a moodily introspective drama about grief before implausibly morphing into a stale thriller.,2/4
11197,October Sky,"The plot follows the usual formula, so that were it a rocket, one could predict within a matter of feet where it would land.",2.5/4
11198,Octopussy,Octopussy is a very minor entry in the Bond franchise.,2.5/4

11205,Ode to Joy,Ode to Joy is about a man with a disease that causes him to pass out whenever he experiences pleasure. He'd be safe seeing this movie.,1/4
11206,Of Gods and Men,"The movie has a mournful electricity, as we come to realize it's about accepting the inevitable.",8/10
11207,Of Love and Shadows,Nice performances by Connelly and Banderas can't make up for the rest of this snoozefest.,2/4
11208,Of Men And War,"Of Men and War refuses to mask or simplify the harsh realities of PTSD. This stubbornness, an insistence that the roughness of war be taken seriously, makes the film an essential document of 21st century American conflict.",4/5
11209,Of Unknown Origin,An intelligent overlooked horror film about writer's block.,3/5
11210,Off the Map,"A film of quiet beauty, striking comedy and touching truths.",3.5/5
11211,Off and Running,"Ultimately uplifting, this endearing bio-pic offers a wonderful warts-and-all look from the inside out at both the blessings and challenges of trans-cultural adoption.",4/4
11212,The Offence,The film was in some ways spoiled but not ruined by the pretentiously arty way it was directed by Sidney Lumet.,B
11213,Office Christmas Party,"Make no mistake: This is an R-rated comedy... But unlike say, Bad Santa 2, you don't feel like you need to take a shower afterward. A rum-laced glass of eggnog will probably do the trick.",B+

11215,An Officer and a Gentleman,Overhyped - but worthwhile,3/5
11216,Officer Downe,"Officer Downe has nearly every element it needs to be an over-the-top, gross-out, truly funny, deeply weird, comic book adaptation, and some driving music to boot. These disparate elements, however, never jell into a single whole.",6.8/10
11217,Official Secrets,The film relies on its lead star and Knightley is more than equipped for the task of carrying it on her shoulders.,3/5
11218,La Historia Oficial (The Official Story),"The Official Story is part polemic, part thriller, part tragedy. It belongs on the list with films like Z, Missing and El Norte, which examine the human aspects of political unrest.",4/4

11221,"Oh, God!",I was struck by just how good Denver was. It's surprising he didn't get more roles based on his debut performance.,80/100
11222,"Oh, God! Book II","Oh, God! Book II qualifies as a sequel only because of its title and the irreplaceable presence of George Burns in the title role. Otherwise, it seems to have lost faith in the film it's based on.",2/4

11225,Oh! What A Lovely War,Remains the most interesting and daring film Attenborough ever made.,4/5
11226,O' Horten,"Too cute by half, filled with myriad forced moments of magic, O'Horten attempts to cast a nuanced spell, but ends up making rather little impression at all.",42/100
11227,OKA!,That the filmmaker at least makes a concerted effort to tweak what in most hands would be an offensively whitewashed dark-continent parable is worth some measure of praise.,3/5
11228,Okami kodomo no ame to yuki (The Wolf Children Ame and Yuki),"This is expert visual storytelling, dwelling on the emotion of particular moments with powerful and occasionally devastating effect.",4/5
11229,Okja,"Okja isn't perfect; it falls down when the absurd and the serious ricochet back and forth between scenes, making it hard to track with the film's tone. But it's easily forgivable; this is a big, ambitious movie, and when it works, it is ridiculously fun.",4/5
11230,Oklahoma!,"Changed the face of the musical After The Sound of Music, it's the best-loved Rogers & Hammerstein film adaptation, deservedly so.",A-
11231,The General Line (Generalnaya liniya),The now famous scene in which Eisenstein juxtaposes footage of a newly working milk machine with a gushing water fountain is a kind of visual symbolism that Eisenstein employs frequently throughout his films.,3.5/4
11232,Old Fashioned,"Old Fashioned is excruciatingly dull. It's like watching a movie in slow motion. I had to force myself to stop looking at my watch, because it was discouraging how little time had gone by whenever I checked.",1/4
11233,Old Goats,"A low-key, homemade pleasure; a quiet, appealing film about a late chapter in life.",3/4
11234,Old Gringo,"There is a potentially wonderful story at the heart of Old Gringo, but the movie never finds it -- the screenplay blasts away in every direction except the bulls-eye.",2/4
11235,Old Joy,"This film reminded me of a Raymond Carver short story or a John Cassavettes film in that emotions rule the day, but their root is never fully explained. You just get a feeling.",4/5
11236,Old School,"Neither funny nor likable nor charming nor particularly entertaining, Old School is a big-screen comedic bust that flunks out in every department.",1.5/4
11237,Old Stone (Lao Shi),Ma's ambitious feature debut will tie your stomach in knots and make you question everything from moral responsibility to individualism in the new China.,3/5
11238,Old Yeller,Director Robert Stevenson understands how lightweight the first part is and never tries to make it seem more important that it is. His saves the energy and emphasis for the last act.,3/4
11239,Oldboy,You gotta see what the folks in this movie do. Incredible!,9/10
11240,Oldboy,"Spike Lee turns Josh Brolin into a full-bodied antihero in this all-American remake of a Korean cult movie, but the story remains a bloody bag of tricks.",B-
11241,Oleanna,"To my astonishment, it is not a very good film. I am not sure why.",2/4
11242,Oliver!,"An exciting experience for young viewers, and is substantial enough for those who want some tension along with the fluffy songs.",91/100
11243,Oliver & Company,"Despite three screenwriters and 13 names credited for the story, the script quickly sinks into a predictable 'girl-meets-pet, girl-loses-pet, girl-and -pet-reunite' sap-trap.",2.5/4
11244,Oliver Twist,"Charles Dickens' novel rendered on the screen by an ambitious filmmaker, David Lean, is a flawed film of visual and emotional power.",81/100
11245,Oliver's Story,Senseless sequels aren't always limited to cheesy action flicks and comic book adaptations.,64/100
11246,Olivia (The Pit of Loneliness),"Olivia is an entertainingly scripted scenario of repressed lust, exemplified in every possibly way, but quite brilliantly through a script filled with observational bon mots.",4/5
11247,Olympic Dreams,"At its core, Olympic Dreams is about chasing one's dreams.",4/5
11248,"Olympic Pride, American Prejudice","The fearlessly blunt Olympic Pride, American Prejudice is freed from the crowd-pleasing constraints often imposed on the biopic genre.",3/4
11249,Olympus Has Fallen,The film spends its first act establishing a flimsy emotional groundwork before gleefully taking a sledgehammer to it just seconds into act two.,2.5/4
11250,Om Shanti Om,"Both a homage to and parody of Bollywood, this cinematic feast delivered straight from the heart of the film industry will have you glued to your seats till the end.",4/5
11251,Omar,"Paradise Now and The Battle of Algiers explored why people under occupation resort to terrorism; Omar turns its attention to the broader, more long-term consequences of living in oppressed conditions.",3.5/4
11252,The Omega Man,Reasonably good cheese.,3/4
11253,The Omen,Moore's approach fails entirely to capitalise on Damien's creepiness and he might have best been left out entirely; the only adrenaline-pumping moments in the film come from the jump-scares throughout.,3/5
11254,Omen IV - The Awakening,A really lame made-for-television attempt to keep the Omen series going.,2/10
11255,On the Bowery,"Lionel Rogosin's semi-documentary is an unflinching document of skid-row denizens, and humanist cinema at its unsentimental best.",4/4

11257,On a Magical Night (Chambre 212),A rather novel enterprise which is at first highly entertaining.,3/5

11259,"On Any Sunday, The Next Chapter","Slick as a Red Bull motorsports commercial, but it lacks the DIY grit and passion of the original, the greatest motorcycle documentary of them all",2.5/4
11260,On Body and Soul (A Teströl és Lélekröl),"A combination of Terrence Malick, Michel Gondry and Woody Allen with its mix of the meditative, fantastical and neurotic.",B
11261,On Chesil Beach,The movie is a muted elegy to emotional waste.,3/5
11262,On Dangerous Ground,Overcomes its artificial contrivances to become a touching psychological drama about despair and loneliness.,A
11263,On Deadly Ground,"One of the most despised motion pictures, not just among Steven Seagal's works, but also in entire movie history.",2/10
11264,On Golden Pond,Classic drama. Moving exploration of old age.,4/5
11265,On Guard,"This rip-snorting period yarn from France wisely follows two important rules of swashbuckling adventures: It never lets the action overwhelm the plot, and it never, ever takes itself too seriously.",3.5/5
11266,On Her Majesty's Secret Service,"If only Sean Connery had starred in On Her Majesty's Secret Service instead of George Lazenby. If he had and with just a few tweaks, this could have been the best Bond movie in the entire franchise.",3/4

11268,On Moonlight Bay,"...fun, frothy, and filled with an abundance of good, old-fashioned tunes.",6/10
11269,On the Basis of Sex,"With few modifications, ""On the Basis of Sex"" could have been made 30 years ago, and its rousing portrait of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg would be a cheesy tearjerker with purpose. Today, it's out of touch.",C
11270,On the Beach at Night Alone (Bamui haebyun-eoseo honja),"""On The Beach At Night Alone"" feels like it will be exceptional even for longtime diehard Hong Sang-Soo fans.",A-
11271,On the Ice,"While MacLean certainly has a keen eye, the rest of his storytelling facilities haven't quite caught up with it yet.",2/5
11272,On The Job,"A nose-to-the-ground crime thriller that also doubles as a wide-ranging portrait of official corruption in the Philippines, On the Job has little trouble delivering the genre goods.",2.5/4
11273,On the One,Both [lead] actors are as likable as everything else in this dulcet entertainment.,3/4
11274,On the Outs,It will break your heart. Never manipulative and unflinchingly honest ... it's filled with poignant images and painfully accurate dialog.,3.5/4
11275,On the Road,Walter Salles' take is ultimately a failed attempt to adapt the unadaptable.,C-

11281,Once I Was A Beehive,"The movie has an infectious optimism that, for a viewer, translates into pure joy.",B+
11282,Once in the Life,The pingpong repetition of dialogue is more precious than poetic and heavy silences and actorly asides draw out a slim story that packs few dramatic surprises.,6/10

11284,Once Upon a Deadpool,"Well, Once Upon a Deadpool does indeed work, despite having its star conspicuously clean up his act.",3.5/5
11285,Once Upon a Forest,Once Upon a Forest has a good heart -- I liked the way it treated its themes -- but the movie is kind of dumb.,2.5/4
11286,Once Upon a Time in America,"The film seems to be too ambiguous for its own good. But somehow it holds together, and becomes a masterpiece, and a wonderful little exit piece for the genius Mr. Leone.",4/4
11287,Once Upon a Time in Anatolia,A cinematic experience that lingers long in the mind and demands repeat viewings.,4.5/5
11288,Once Upon a Time in Brooklyn,"As far as derivative crime sagas go, Paul Borghese's film might represent the new gold standard of shameless barrel-scraping.",1/4
11289,Once Upon a Time In Hollywood,"The film is a dirty, sensually realized feat with many shots of sensualized feet. Time will tell whether this is Tarantino's greatest work, but it incorporates so much of what made this brash filmmaker provocative, great, obnoxious and brilliant.",A
11290,Once upon a Time in Mexico,"This third chapter in Rodriguez's Mariachi trilogy is perhaps his best film yet--a lively, outrageously enjoyable action comedy with serious subtext.",4.5/5
11291,Once Upon a Time in the West,Once Upon a Time in the West is often mesmerizing cinema.,5/5
11292,Once Upon a Time in Venice,"Willis finds a few laughs in this limp, low-budget action comedy, the sort of lazy paycheck picture he used to do when he was big box office.",1.5/4
11293,Once Were Warriors,"Once Were Warriors is filled with memorable images, solid acting and a keen sense of place and character, but without even realizing it, Tamahori has also told a story about urban sub-cultures far from his own home.",8/10
11294,Ondine,"Funny, whimsical and as warming as a big bowl of Irish stew.",3/5
11295,One on One,"It also has some very good sequences that are not at all expected, including the smashing basketball game that concludes the film.",3.5/5
11296,One,A moving and elegantly delivered drama about the waning of a friendship.,3/5
11297,One & Two,"The silent scenes, which hold so much power in the first act, feel emptier and emptier, the closer the conclusion nears.",C
11298,One Bad Cat: The Reverend Albert Wagner Story,"The film finds its footing whenever Johnny Coleman, professor of African-American Studies and Fine Arts at Oberlin College in Ohio, speaks openly about Wagner's troublesome images and the appeal those images have for whites.",2.5/4
11299,One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern,The interviews with him are worth the price of admission.,4/4
11300,One Crazy Summer,"As teen comedies go, it's not awful",3/5
11301,"One Cut, One Life",The doc emerges not so much as a glimpse into the mind of a dying artist than as a factual drama on how loved ones are impacted by an individual's death.,3/4
11302,One Day,"For all her clear-eyed understanding of life's inevitable disappointments, Scherfig can only view her film's romantic angle with a combination of inevitability and gross sentimentality.",2.5/4

11304,One-Eyed Jacks,Very cool. It's too bad Brando never directed again.,5/5
11305,One Fall,"Despite its grander ambitions, the film ultimately feels minor and superficial.",2/5
11306,One False Move,"Here is a crime movie that lifts you up and carries you along in an ominously rising tide of tension, building to an emotional payoff of amazing power.",4/4
11307,One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,Quietly shocking.,9/10
11308,One for the Money,To compare this mess to a sitcom would be an insult to sitcoms.,1/4
11309,One From the Heart,This has matured over the years into a very likeable and moving romance with much to recommend it.,4/5
11310,One Good Cop,"One Good Cop wanted to manipulate my emotions, and I was willing to let it try, but finally it was so shameless that I'd had enough.",2/4
11311,One Hour Photo,"Though nicely shot, with a few pleasant photographic details thrown in, and containing a deranged lead role, One Hour Photo doesn't follow through on the complexities it tries so hard to achieve.",2/5
11312,One Last Night,"The film has several good ideas in it, and the characters are intriguing, but [Anthony] Sabet doesn't quite pick up anything and run with it.",3/5
11313,One Last Thing,...buoyed by several superb performances and occasional bursts of authenticity.,2.5/4
11314,One Lucky Elephant,Flora the elephant is quite a crowd pleaser. So is this delightful documentary!,4/5
11315,One Magic Christmas,"This is very unfortunate. What we have here is a movie with an intelligent screenplay, wonderful performances and skillful direction, but it is a tactical miscalculation from beginning to end.",2/4
11316,One Man's Hero,An interesting historical drama about a little-known incident that would have been much better had someone like John Milius directed it.,3/5
11317,One Missed Call,This is nothing less than bottom-of-the-barrel junk.,0.5/4
11318,One Missed Call,"O roteiro pode não ser dos mais originais (e a conclusão deixa alguns buracos na trama), mas Miike cria um clima absolutamente assustador - algo raro no terror moderno.",4/5
11319,One More Time (When I Live My Life Over Again),"""When I Live My Life Over Again"" is a low-key pleasure with big rewards, the kind worth crooning about.",B+
11320,One Night In Bangkok,One Night in Bangkok fatally stalls whenever Kaosayananda has to develop his hitman drama beyond place-holding cliches.,1/4
11321,One October,"It's Pigeon's sincere approach here and throughout the documentary that holds the audience's attention. His dulcet tone and affable manner allow him to get close to people, gain their trust, and encourage their openness.",B+
11322,One of Us,It's incisive in its condemnation of the oppression innate in the social structure of Brooklyn's Hasidic communities.,3/4
11323,One Small Hitch,One Small Hitch should have settled on being a cute but insipid romantic comedy. By emphasizing a lead character who does nothing more than play into a wedding fantasy in hopes that a frog will turn into her prince is ultimately more tragic than comic.,4.3/10
11324,One Track Heart: The Story of Krishna Das,An emotionally wrought documentary about the spiritual journey and immense love story of chant master Krishna Das.,5/5
11325,One True Thing,Pumps new life into the dying-nobly-of-a-horrible-disease genre,B

11328,Ong-Bak (Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior),The film's middle stretch is an unmistakable tour de brute force.,2.5/4

11331,Only God Forgives,There's an old expression in musical theater - you don't leave humming the lights.,5/10
11332,Only Human (Seres queridos),"An energetic, colourful farce that attempts, in its own small way, to figure out why people find it so hard to live in harmony.",3/5
11333,Only Lovers Left Alive,"It's an offbeat, fun, and frequently very funny film, lifted out of disposability by some wonderfully rich production design, music cuts and photography, and by the cherishable performances of the leads.",B+
11334,Only the Brave,Only the Brave is without question the best firefighter film since Backdraft and one that pays tribute to the brave men that sacrificed their own lives to protect thousands of others.,8/10
11335,Only the Strong Survive,"Winningly revived soul music, reports of whose death have been grossly exaggerated.",3/4
11336,Only The Young,"At times, the film's lyrical drift shades into incoherence, spackled with globs of free-floating voiceover and Larry Clark-like indolent moments.",3/5
11337,Onward,Onward uses a world of magic to tell a universally powerful story about loss and family; this story of sibling elves to one of the most human things that will be seen in theaters all year,4/5
11338,Opal Dream,A touching Australian film about the healing and liberating powers of imagination and love in a besieged family and a divided mining community.,4/5
11339,Open 24 Hours,Open 24 Hours spins its wheels figuring out just what it wants to be. Slasher? Commentary on abuse? Mystery/thriller?,5/10
11340,Open City,It is still a work of considerable merit.,B
11341,Open Grave,"Individual moments linger, but the film is merely a rough draft of a thriller.",1.5/4
11342,Open Range,Kevin keeps all the actors on screen at an energy level that wavers between laconic and stoic and stoic may be overstating the case just a smidge,2/5
11343,The Open Road,"A screenplay that feels written by numbers, but excellent performances make it deserve more attention than this late summer dump",C
11344,Open Season,"High energy and lively performances keep this animated film entertaining, even if there's nothing terribly original about it.",3/5
11345,Open Water,"Open Water is horribly and blissfully intense, the sort of grass-roots thriller that will have you squirming in your seat as each successive dorsal fin breaks the waves",4.5/5
11346,Open Water 2: Adrift,...genuinely tense...,3/4
11347,Open Water 3: Cage Dive,"With basically no association with Open Water 1-2 other than the ""stranded with sharks"" set-up, this sequel is so dreadful that it will have you rooting for the sharks.",1/5
11348,Open Windows,"Open Windows spams viewers with an overload of information, creating a technological nightmare that gets lost in its own web of lies.",5/10
11349,Open Your Eyes (Abre los Ojos),A film with enough intellectual meat on its stylish bones to give more adventurous moviegoers something to chew on afterward.,4/5
11350,Opening Night,"Gena Rowlands plays the role at perfect pitch: She is able to suggest, even in the midst of seemingly ordinary moments, the controlled panic of a person who needs a drink, right here, right now.",3/4
11351,Opera,very possibly a dark parody of The Sound of Music,3/4
11352,Armour of God (Long xiong hu di) (Operation Condor 2),"Overflowing with Chan's trademark stunt setpieces (not to mention his own goony brand of extremely broad slapstick), the film's a dazzler...",3/5
11353,Operation Avalanche,"While Operation Avalanche has its share of humour, the clever problem-solving the crew devises is extraordinary, and considerably sharper than the James Brolin-OJ Simpson vehicle Capricorn One.",4/5
11354,Operation Chromite,Exciting if occasionally awkward ...,2.5/4
11355,Operation Condor (Fei ying gai wak) (Armour of God II),Far and away 1997's best comedy.,4/5
11356,Operation Crossbow,WWII tale of Nazi rocket plans has its moments; including Sophia Loren doesn't hurt.,3/5
11357,Operation Dumbo Drop,Slow and tedious ... All of the actors seemed to be on autopilot.,1/4
11358,Operation: Endgame (Rogue's Gallery),"As the body count climbs and a pair of bickering surveillance guys watch in jaded fascination, the director, Fouad Mikati, reveals himself to be far more competent with blunt trauma than subtle interaction.",2/5
11359,Operation Finale,"A fascinating tale of world history that manages to worm its way inside the uncomfortable headspace of pure evil, but It definitely requires tighter focus and a little more suspense",3/5
11360,Operation Mekong,"Dante Lam has orchestrated pure chaotic mayhem dripping with raw emotion and sloppy, crowd-pleasing violence.",3.75/5
11361,Operation Petticoat,Hilarious for its oh-so-taboo treatment of things like underwear.,3.5/5
11362,Operation Red Sea,"Basically every great, good and decent war movie rolled into one amazing must-see spectacle.",9/10
11363,Operator,Smart and compelling analysis of self-medication in the age of digital manipulation.,B+
11364,Ophelia,"That sound you hear is cordial applause, and the riffling of an audience paging through their high-school-English-class paperbacks to double-check the facts.",B
11365,Opportunity Knocks,"[Carvey is] an accomplished actor who can sell a real character. I wish the screenplay had developed that side a little more, and gone easier on the standard crime stuff.",2.5/4
11366,The Opposite of Sex,Beyond the narration and the homosexual element... a fairly typical 1990s indie sex comedy,B-
11367,The Opposite Sex,"See the original ""The Women"" instead.",3/5
11368,The Opposite Sex And How To Live With Them,"Hardly a classic, but Brown and Pollak provide decent comic relief.",2/5
11369,Or (My Treasure),"Earnest and, for at least its first half, plotless.",2/4
11370,Orange County,"Jake Kasdan (son of Lawrence) directs Colin Hanks (son of Tom) in Orange County, a Wonder Boys for the teeny-bopper sect.",2.5/4

11372,Oranges And Sunshine,"You want to be moved more than you are by a film that doesn't tap the emotions half as much as the facts. Loach shows promise, though.",3/5
11373,Orca - The Killer Whale,One of the first and worst of the Jaws rip-offs.,1/5
11374,Orchestra Of Exiles,Its episodic nature poses a narrative challenge that director Josh Aronson's just barely feature-length documentary can't quite surmount.,2.5/4

11377,Ordinary People,"An uncomfortable film, one that leaves you aching for its characters. Expect a bit of a funk afterward.",9/10
11378,Ordinary World,"Ordinary World is worth a play for curious parties, but it deviates from Green Day's finest work in that you'll probably only want to experience it once.",3/5
11379,The Organization,"There's a bit of shooting, a few identities are untangled, and the movie comes to an unmourned end.",2/4
11380,"Orgasm, Inc.","Liz Canner's entertaining and infuriating expose about the profit-driven pharmaceutical industry's commercialization of female sexuality is a must-see for women of all ages, their lovers and physicians.",4/5

11393,Oscar and Lucinda,"There's a lack of dramatic focus, and the leads fail to evince any particular chemistry.",2/4
11394,"Oslo, August 31st","Trier writes his hero into a very tight corner, but finds a simultaneously graceful and uncompromising way out of it. Neat trick, that.",B+
11395,Osmosis Jones,A picture that has all the charm of 'Cool World' and all the laughs of 'Larger Than Life'...a pretty noxious combination.,D
11396,OSS 117: Rio ne répond plus (Lost in Rio),"Less raucous than CAIRO, NEST OF SPIES, this new adventure for the suave but bigoted French super-agent is still extremely good fun, with its amusing script, hilarious characters and astonishingly detailed production design.",3/5
11397,The Osterman Weekend,It rattles along well enough as a thriler of the political paranoia variety.,3/5
11398,OT: Our Town,"A whole world can be fit into 76 minutes, and that's what the splendid documentary OT: our town manages to do.",4/5
11399,The Other Boleyn Girl,"A hybrid of trashy period piece and stately Masterpiece Theater episode, this kitschy melodrama can't decide how much to exploit its juicy text about lusty King Henry VIII and his relationships with the Boleyn sisters.",C+
11400,The Other End of the Line,... a buffet of romantic comedy comfort food: the good old American standbys complemented by bland international dishes.,C
11401,The Other Guys,The other (better) Cop Out.,3.5/5
11402,Other People's Money,Danny DeVito is the right actor to play Larry the Liquidator. He doesn't have to say that he uses big piles of money to compensate for the lack of love in his life. We know. We can see it in Larry's eyes.,3.5/4
11403,The Other Sister,"Builds toward an emotional crescendo that will fill you with tears, many of joy.",3/4

11405,Ouija,Man am I sick of seeing people getting dragged out of shot by invisible forces.,1/5
11406,Ouija: Origin of Evil,"Witty, inventively rigged scares, alongside the cast's solid performances, raise this one above the average cash-grab.",4/5
11407,Our Brand Is Crisis,"An amazing insight into the corporate swill that politics has become, even on the supposed 'liberal' side of the game.",4/5
11408,Our Brand is Crisis,David Gordon Green's boisterous but hollow election drama offers an ultra-cynical take on political campaigns as a series of mass manipulations.,40/100

11410,Our City Dreams,Candid and unpretentious.,3/4
11411,Our Evil (Mal nosso),Our Evil is an interesting film and a bold attempt at doing something different. Galli will be one to watch.,3/5

11413,Our Hospitality,"This isn't one of [Keaton's] best, despite some amusing scenes.",2.5/4
11414,Our House,"Our House continues the 2018 trend - started by A Quiet Place and Hereditary - of horror movies that are as much about characters, emotions, and ideas as they are about scares.",3.5/4

11416,Our Kind of Traitor,"This is contemporary - not Cold War - le Carr, but no less compelling for that.",3/5
11417,Our Lady of the Assassins,"In Schroeder's careful hands, Colombia becomes a mythic land where the successful delivery of drugs to the US becomes cause for celebration.",3/4
11418,Our Little Sister (Umimachi Diary),"Precisely because it's less emotionally coercive than Kore-eda's last couple of pictures, it's even more moving: rather than lunging full-bore for the solar plexus, the truths it's telling creep up on you.",4/5
11419,Our Man Flint,"If you loved Austin Powers, you have to see what started it all.",4/5
11420,Our Man in Tehran,"It's not a film to get the pulse racing; rather, it's designed to get the brain working.",3.5/5
11421,Our Nixon,"The videos fail in their promise of revealing intimate moments, but the doc highlights how close Nixon, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, and Chapin were in other ways.",2.5/4
11422,Our Song,"It is hard to imagine a movie less self-indulgent than Our Song, or one more completely absorbed in the complex humanity of its subjects.",3.5/5

11427,Out in the Dark,"Sociologically, the film is fascinating; dramatically, it is a borderline disaster.",7/10
11428,Out of Africa,It tells a grand love story in less-than-grand fashion but is nevertheless worth seeing because of all the other things it does right.,3/4
11429,Out of Blue,"There's a light, Lynchian touch throughout. The film can be hilarious while dealing with dark emotions, thanks especially to wonderful performances from Clarkson and Jackie Weaver.",4/5
11430,Out of Print,"As Out Of Print goes on, it becomes clear that the film doesn't really have an angle beyond honouring repertory culture in general and the New Bev in particular.",3/5

11432,Out Of The Dark,Derivative supernatural horror film.,C+

11444,The Outlaw Josey Wales,"As a director, Eastwood's storytelling is subtle and his translation of adventure is quick and dirty.",90/100
11445,Outlaw King,"This Scottish war film is unlikely to compete with Braveheart in anyone's mind, for at its best it is only so much war with rarely any poetry.",2.5/5
11446,Outlaws,"This biker drama is little more than an endless stream of brooding, yelling, and ""badass"" posturing broken up by grisly violence and gratuitous sex scenes.",1/4
11447,Outlaws and Angels,"Surreal and dark in passages, even Moller's direction doesn't quite know what to do when it gets to certain pivotal moments.",C

11454,Outside the Law,"[The movie] is at the very least a superior action film, in which the action sequences are plausible and grounded in reality. It is also a parable in support of anti-colonialism. What it isn't, at the end of the day, is a film about the larger picture.",3/4
11455,The Outsiders,"...the story is faithful to the spirit of the book, both a blessing and a curse.",5/10

11553,Parched,An explosive Indian drama about the toxins of gender inequality and the exhilarations of women's empowerment.,4.5/5
11554,Parental Guidance,"Thanks to a wonderful cast and Crystal's good intentions, Parental Guidance is a much better movie than one might expect it to be.",7/10
11555,Parenthood,"The performances are all wonderful, each actor having received some sort of acting plum and each giving it his all. Director Ron Howard is very good at comedy, and his timing is expert throughout the film.",2.5/4
11556,Parents,"Because it speaks to a terror that lurks deep within our memories, Parents has the potential to be a great horror film. But it never knows quite what to do with its inspiration.",2/4

11575,Party Monster,"Fact-based story of drugs and death in ""clubland"" is boring and banal, failing in its attempt to shock and scandalize.",1/5
11576,Pass Over,"Once again, Spike Lee has found an innovative theatrical production and brought it to blistering cinematic life.",B+
11577,A Passage to India,"The film is very much 'a full theatrical meal,' and one that conveys a lot of 'the multiplicity of life' one seldom sees on the screen these days.",4/5
11578,Passage to Mars,"Unable to develop any of the team members as personalities or to evoke the supposed otherworldliness of its arctic setting, it becomes a testament to the fact that a sense of wonder doesn't mean jack without the talent or art needed to express it.",D
11579,Passed Away,"Passed Away is one of those movies that introduces a family filled with troubled people, brings them all together at a funeral and solves their dilemmas, while also trying desperately to be funny and heartwarming",2/4

11627,Pawn Sacrifice,"""Pawn Sacrifice"" whips up a dervish of energy and is mostly engaging, yet the movie isn't a definitive checkmate. The narrative ferocity is unable, try as it might, to smooth over some of the bumps in the story and gaps in the plotting.",B

11682,Performance,"Strange, confusing, and psychedelic, all are apt descriptions for this easy to follow story but most difficult film to keep track of.",A
11683,Perfume: The Story of a Murderer,This tale of a brilliant sociopath is disturbing and often uncomfortable to watch. And it's also magical filmmaking.,4/5
11684,Period. End of Sentence.,"Craft-wise, it is nothing remarkable, at least in context of the world it represents. But if social relevance is a part of filmmaking in narrative fiction, social relevance is filmmaking in narrative non-fiction.",3/5

11706,Peter's Friends,"If film is basically a voyeuristric medium, then one of the questions that might be asked about ""Peter's Friends"" is: Would we like to be one of these friends, and attend such a reunion ourselves? I would.",3.5/4
11707,Pete's Dragon,"A Touching, humourous, and ultimately warm family film.",3/5
11708,Pete's Dragon,"It abandons its subtlety and sense of mystery en route to becoming a typically moralistic screed about the preservation of the nuclear family, alongside an obvious but never-quite-resolved cautionary tale about the importance of conservation.",2/4

11721,Phantom of the Opera,"If the film never goes full-tilt horror until the somewhat rushed climax, it at least manages to retain a spooky tone, and boasts a few shocks and some exciting scenes. It's rarely dull.",4/5

11723,Phantom Thread,Reynolds mentions that he likes to leave hidden notes and messages stitched into the dresses he creates as a way of forever imbuing that individual garment with a piece of himself; Daniel Day-Lewis does the same in every single one of his performances,4/5

11730,Phil,Greg Kinnear combines acting with directing in a role that exudes nice-guy-ness that few other performers can duplicate as well.,B

11741,Phoenix,t's a film that will not rise from either its ashes or clichés.,C-
11742,Phoenix,"""Phoenix""is as much a portrait of a woman longing to find herself again as a portrait of an entire nation longing for a way to re-build.",A-
11743,Phoenix Forgotten,Its real value lies in shaking up a moribund genre... if not to revitalize then at least to remind us how often it settled for less than it could have been.,3/5

11753,Picasso and Braque Go to the Movies,"As a rambling rumination on turn-of-the-century aestheticism with brazen flourishes of apophenia, the documentary is strangely effective, but we're left aching for more specific piece-by-piece analysis.",2.5/4

11755,Pickpocket,"There is incredible buried passion in a Bresson film, but he doesn't find it necessary to express it. Also great tension and excitement, tightly reined in.",4/4
11756,Picnic,"Clunky and awkward, with inane dialogue, it's a movie to show how attitudes have changed.",2/4
11757,Picnic at Hanging Rock,"As a tantalizing puzzle, a tease, a suggestion of a forbidden answer just out of earshot, it works hypnotically and very nicely indeed.",3.5/4
11758,Picture Me: A Model's Diary,This doc is an 82-minute series of nonbombshells: Models are pampered! They have body-image issues! And sometimes they have to contend with the unwanted sexual advances of male photographers!,2/5

11768,Piglet's Big Movie,"While nowhere near as captivating as ABC's ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,"" this is a pleasant enough family diversion.",2.5/4
11769,Pilgrim Song,"The film makes the most of the natural widescreen wonder of its Appalachian forests and mountains, and its sense of isolation is a welcome change from the familiar urbanism of most mini-budgeted features.",3.5/4
11770,Pilgrimage,"The film understands the importance of appearances and loyalties in a person's life. These commitments-either to popes, kings, or gods-are built on faith and risk.",8.3/10

11773,Pimp,"Lean, lurid and unsentimental exploitation thriller that works thanks to a mean makeover of former child star Keke Palmer.",2.5/4
11774,Pin Cushion,"Taking a very dark turn late in the second act, Pin Cushion's eccentric craft-fair aesthetic is ultimately protective cushioning wrapped around a broken heart.",B
11775,Pina,"It's a surprise to see Wim Wenders embracing 3D in its full, feature-length glory but the medium works well to capture the graceful swirl of the German choreographer's work.",3/5

11777,Piñero,The film's rhythm is so deftly crude it unwinds like an underground 80s cinematic relic.,3/4
11778,Ping Pong,"An unabashed crowd-pleaser, Hugh Hartford's table-top portrait avoids patronising its aged subjects, bouncing between sweetly satirical and sincerely moving.",4/5
11779,Ping Pong Playa,"This lighter-than-air comedy couldn't be more different from director Jessica Yu's previous entry, 'Protagonist.'",B
11780,Ping Pong Summer,"The problem with basing an entire movie on nostalgia is that while it may hit your target audience right in its sweet spot, for everyone else it may seem like little more than an extended version of ""Guess you had to be there.""",6.1/10
11781,Pink Cadillac,Calling Pink Cadillac dumb is an insult to dumb movies.,1/4

11794,The Pirate,"All told it's an enjoyable work, albeit one of the director's minor films.",C+
11795,Pirate Radio (The Boat That Rocked),"Despite a terrific cast and a cracking '60s soundtrack, this overlong comedy-drama falls painfully flat, thanks to a non-existent plot, some badly judged character moments and a total absence of laughs.",2/5

11953,Presumed Innocent,"I think I liked it much more the first time that I saw it a few years ago, and maybe because I didn't know how it was gonna end at the time. Knowing what I did this time around, the film was still quite engaging for the most part.",6/10

12003,The Private Lives of Pippa Lee,The Private Lives of Pippa Lee proves that The Ballad of Jack and Rose was no fluke and that Miller can produce work just as good as the best of recent American independent cinema.,3/5
12004,The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes,"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes is comparatively mild Billy Wilder and rather daring Sherlock Holmes, not a perfect mix, perhaps, but a fond and entertaining one.",3/5
12005,Private Peaceful,"It's left to the leads to keep us engaged, a tall order given their film's old-fashioned, fusty feel.",2/5

12053,Public Access,"When it comes right down to it, though, Access isn't accessible enough, and it doesn't sprint to the finish.",5/10
12054,The Public Eye,"There are moments in The Public Eye that made me think a little about Casablanca, especially the earlier scenes when Bogart is still mad at Bergman. Higher praise is not necessary.",4/4
12055,Puccini for Beginners,"This a fun little film, and one deserving of a wider audience.",4/5
12056,Puerto Ricans In Paris,The film simply limps to predetermined truths that hypocritically advocate the maintenance of placid family values.,1.5/4

12058,Pulp Fiction,See it on a big screen with lots of folks in the audience for maximum enjoyment.,4/4
12059,Pulse,"What's the point in warning of the perils of the information age by creating a scareless, formulaic film that fits so snugly into the thoughtless consumerism of the culture you're trying to criticize?",1/4
12060,Octane (Pulse),Starts as a pretty effective little thriller in the 'Road Trip turns deadly' vein -- and then takes a hard left turn into a field full of stupid.,2.5/5
12061,Pulse (Kairo),Brings some of the creepiest imagery yet seen to bear on the question of how ghosts might manifest themselves before the living.,B

12077,Puppet Master II,A bad time for the series. Go from the original straight to part 3.,2/5
12078,Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich,"It all feels cheap and looks cheap, a far cry from what S. Craig Zahler can do when overseeing a film's words as well as its images.",2/4
12079,The Puppet Masters,This movie is so wonderfully archaic and reminiscent of 1950s alien invasion stories that one cannot help but like it -- despite rather lacklustre directing.,2/4

12082,Purgatory House,"A fairly compelling movie, but when one realizes that the screenplay was penned by a 14-year-old gal...it adds a whole new perspective to all the angst being tossed around.",4/5

12100,A Pyromaniac's Love Story,"A Pyromaniac's Love Story starts out like a lighthearted charmer, and then it goes on and on and on -- circling the same plot idea so doggedly that I began to wonder idly what it might have been like as a short subject.",2/4
12101,Q,...There are no hidden messages or deep symbolic meanings to ponder.,B+
12102,Q & A,"Q&A is a major film by one of our finest mainstream directors. As both a portrait of modern-day corruption and an act of sheer storytelling bravura, it is not to be missed.",A-

12128,Quest For Camelot,"The images are playful and serviceably lush, but the story and characters might have come out of a screenwriting software program, and the songs (sung by Celine Dion and Steve Perry, among others) are Vegas-pop wallpaper.",C
12129,Quest for Fire,"Not to everyone's taste, certainly, but those of an anthropological bent will appreciate Quest For Fire's admirably detailed portrayal of early man's struggles for survival.",4/5
12130,Quick Change,A delightful romp that generously allows the unknowns who dot the large supporting cast to garner the biggest laughs.,3/4
12131,Quicksilver,"The movie has moments when it comes to life, when it threatens to tell a story about interesting people, and then it wanders off into inane scenes designed only to sell records.",2/4

12135,Quill: The Life of a Guide Dog,It's possible to love one of these movies and hate the other...,2/4
12136,Quills,A powerful and atmospheric film that delivers a barrage of images and concepts of both sexual and philosophical natures.,3.5/4
12137,Quinceañera,A perfectly serviceable weepie and coming-of-age drama.,3/5
12138,Quincy,"Drawing on extraordinary archival footage and intimate moments shot over the last five years, Jones and co-director Alan Hicks paint a human portrait of this larger-than-life figure.",B+
12139,Quintet,"Slow, confusing, and for Altman fans only.",2/5
12140,Quitters,There is obvious talent in the storytelling but at times the reserved style of filmmaking feels televisual and there 's no spark to really get the film going.,2/5

12147,Rabid,Ultimately Rabid boils down to zombified sluts and shock moments but it's an irresistible combination that Cronenberg handles well.,3/5
12148,Rabid,"Laura Vandervoort gives the performance of her life and the Soska's are back on form with this visceral dark fairytale. Seductive, sensual, and gory as Hell, Rabid is a rare example of a remake worthy of your time.",4/5
12149,Rabid Dogs (Enragés),"There's no reason for Rabid Dogs to exist, as even character identity and motivation receives little attention.",2/4
12150,Rabies,Rabies' ideas about mankind's penchant for hostility are generic and monotonous.,C+

12177,Raging Bull,"Often unpleasant and painful to watch, the film is a no-holds-barred look at a violent man in a brutal sport, in which, amazingly, the wholly unsympathetic LaMotta attains a state of grace at the end that is inspiring.",5/5
12178,Ragtime,"Fine, sprawling period piece. A great swan song for Cagney.",4/5
12179,Raiders of the Lost Ark,"It has the perfect blend of action, humor, and suspense. And Harrison Ford defined the action hero for the new decade.",4/4
12180,Raiders!: The Story of the Greatest Fan Film Ever Made,"The will-they-won't-they dynamic of the film grips you and it's almost impossible not to root for Strompolos and Zala, especially when things on set get hairy as the final explosive scene goes awry.",4/5

12239,Reach Me,"Reach Me certainly reaches for the stars, but it won't touch any viewers through its jumbled collection of heartless, one-note stories.",3/10
12240,The Reader,"The well-acted film deals with relevant issues (first love, burden of the Holocaust), but it's too literal, and the second half is a disappointingly pedestrian court melodrama.",B-
12241,Ready,"Just like his previous Bollywood masala flicks, Khan is once again in his element showcasing his on-screen charisma.",3/5
12242,Ready or Not,"""I was pleasantly surprised by the humor, and the absolute powerhouse performance by Weaving.""",7/10
12243,Ready Player One,Spielberg's dizzying foray into '80s pop culture fandom is a return to pure pop escapism.,B
12244,Ready to Mingle (Bachelorettes) (Solteras),"Bachelorettes takes the stereotypes and takes them to question ""machismo"" and gender roles with an effective comedic cast. [Full Review in Spanish]",3/5
12245,Ready to Rumble,The film has no real intent whatsoever other than to spew juvenile sight gags and jokes derived in the 4th grade boy's bathroom.,2/10
12246,Ready to Wear (Prêt-à-Porter),It seems like a very long wait to get to the various punch lines.,2.5/4
12247,Real Genius,Everyone plays their part in making this a very funny movie.,4.5/5
12248,Real Life,"There's a little bit of genuine prescience, inspiration, and intelligence coursing through its veins, but mostly that smattering of each just makes you crave more.",2.5/4
12249,Real Steel,Real Steel is much like Atom: clunky and a little flat-footed but charming enough to stay in the fight.,B-
12250,Real Women Have Curves,A pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances.,3/4
12251,Reality,It's a likable film played with gusto and heart - though fundamentally a little sentimental and predictable.,3/5
12252,Reality (Réalité),Quentin Dupieux has a talent for rendering otherworldly concepts banal in a manner that reflects the stymied desires of his characters.,2.5/4
12253,Reality Bites,"What unwritten law prevented the makers of Reality Bites from observing that their heroine can't shoot video worth a damn, that their hero is a jerk, and that their villain is the most interesting person in the movie?",2/4
12254,Reality Queen!,"While Reality Queen! seeks to parody contemporary culture, the irony here is that it is the very vapid thing it mocks.",0.5/5
12255,Realive,"Realive is beautifully produced, with a capable cast and great technical work all round. This polish will effectively glosses over its weaknesses as far as many viewers are concerned.",3/5
12256,Re-Animator,"A deliciously gross horror movie for horror movie fans, director Stuart Gordon's tour de force adapts a series of H.P. Lovecraft stories into a creepy, disquieting comedy.",A
12257,Reap the Wild Wind,"Another overblown Cecil B. DeMille ""epic."" One of his lesser efforts.",2/5
12258,The Reaping,"Just in time for Passover, Easter, and/or any other equinoctial festival on your liturgical calendar comes THE REAPING, an abomination of a film to put the fear of God in us all with its sheer awfulness",0/5
12259,Reasonable Doubt,You may feel as if you're watching two or three abbreviated episodes of Law & Order in quick succession rather than a fully realized movie.,1/4
12260,Rebel in the Rye,It is strange that in a film about J.D. Salinger the best performance doesn't even come from the guy playing him.,B-
12261,Rebel Without a Cause,It sides with the rebellious youths.,B+
12262,Rebels of the Neon God,"Using very little camera movement and a good deal of humor, pathos, and rained out cityscapes, the director crafts an enjoyable, fast-paced, but still poignant, look at modern loneliness.",4/4
12263,Rebound,"The whole thing feels like a half-day of community service, which Lawrence walks through good-naturedly.",C+
12264,Rebuilding Paradise,The whole movie is compelling and moving but I was especially impressed by the first 20 minutes that get you right in the fire,8/10
12265,[Rec] 2,Rec 2 is the only movie in the entire festival that left me wanting more. It's a nonstop rollercoaster ride that grabs the audiences by the throat and never lets go. You breathe when the credits hit and not a single second before.,4/5
12266,[REC] 3 Genesis,This decision to quarantine the shaky camerawork to the pre-credits exposition at once comes as an admission that the handheld cinematography is a gimmick and marks a slide into more conventional (i.e. dull) territory.,34/100
12267,[REC] 4: Apocalypse,The worst of the [REC] movies...,1.5/4
12268,Allegiance,"Michael Connors does a fine job of not passing judgment on his characters, yet his depiction of his main character's dilemma is about the only thing he handles correctly.",1.5/4
12269,Recess: School's Out,There's nothing here that's compelling enough to merit buying a ticket.,2.5/4
12270,Reclaim,Reclaim's highly mechanized plot ensures that the film is over before it even ends.,0.5/4
12271,Recovery Boys,"The final outcome may be mixed, but viewers will concur with a sobbing Ryan that ""helping people who everyone else in society looks down on - it's amazing.""",5/5
12272,The Recruit,A CIA thriller that plays some very tricky and entertaining spy games.,B+
12273,Red,"If you don't smile at the image of a stunningly beautiful Dame Helen Mirren, resplendent in a gorgeous white gown, plowing down gunmen with her 50mm caliber tripod mounted gun, then you simply can't be helped.",B+
12274,Red Tails,So narratively old-fashioned it creaks.,2/5
12275,Red 2,"RED 2 possesses a spark of life other action franchises lack by showing players like Helen Mirren absolutely kicking ass. It's goofy enough to entertain, and badass enough to get the blood pumping.",7/10
12276,"Csillagosok, katonák (The Red and The White)",A war film unlike any other.,4/4
12277,Red Army,"Quite simply, Red Army is fabulous, one of the most fun and fascinating films of the year.",A
12278,The Red Badge of Courage,"Despite the studio's editing hatchet job, this remains a powerful tale of redemption",4/5
12279,Red Christmas,"Red Christmas is just one missed opportunity after the next, and I'm left wishing Anderson had done more with both his story and his characters.",2/5
12280,Red Cliff (Chi Bi),click for full review,2/5
12281,Red Corner,"Everything ... is dominated by actress Bai Ling, who creates a full-blooded character and role model for young girls.",3/4
12282,Red Dawn,Garbage,D-
12283,Red Dog,It was this second half of the film I enjoyed most. The cheesy dialogue is left behind and we get to see these characters (including Red Dog himself) at their most vulnerable.,B+
12284,Red Dog: True Blue,"A classic boy-and-his-dog tale, Red Dog: True Blue has a big heart and bundles of charm...",17/20
12285,Red Dragon,"Red Dragon is less baroque and showy than Hannibal, and less emotionally affecting than Silence. But, like Silence, it's a movie that gets under your skin.",3/4
12286,Red Hill,The Western lives!...in Southeast Australia.,B
12287,Red Hollywood,"In the end, this film is an interesting, but disjointed look at the efforts of blacklisted filmmakers to influence society. It isn't always successful in convincingly illustrating its claims, but it is historically important.",C
12288,Red Hook Summer,It is so wilfully off the scale that it is hard to know quite how to quantify it.,2/5
12289,The Red House,Has its effective moments.,C+
12290,Red Joan,"Most of the fun in Red Joan comes from such overthrown expectations, so it's a shame that the film itself fails to overwhelm - mostly proceeding along dully familiar lines and anything but radical.",2/5
12291,Red Knot,It's no surprise that first-time director Scott Cohen is a nature photographer by trade: he's made one of the most gorgeous movies you'll see this year.,3/5
12292,Red Letter Day,"In many ways Red Letter Day is a humour heavy, daylight spin on The Purge, one which works well, but could benefit from a longer run time.",3/5
12293,Red Lights,A sort of relationship thriller about the discomfort of living in one another's company - and also about the terror of being alone in the night.,B-
12294,Red Lights,"The movie just sort of... peters out, as the fights between good and evil become less intellectual and more physical, and thus more common.",C+
12295,Red Obsession,Who'd have thought a film combining red wine with economics could be so informative and entertaining? Red Obsession is one of the year's best documentaries.,A-
12296,Red Penguins,"Gonzo skates-and-sticks stuff, Slap Shot being dainty by comparison.",3.5/4
12297,Red Planet,Shot and edited so clumsily that pivotal moments of action are obscured.,6/10
12298,Red Riding: 1980,"1980 benefits from calmer direction and a better class of actors, while gradually drawing out an additional serial killer tale that goes beyond journalistic investigation to pry open the black heart of the local law.",B+
12299,Red Riding: 1983,"1983 is executed rather messily and demands a very concentrated viewer, but the rhythms of violation and corruption remain intact, supplying a fulfilling closer to this ambitious project.",B
12300,Red River,There have been many classic westerns but this Hawks masterpiece certainly ranks among the best of the genre.,5/5
12301,Red Road,"Red Road does not make easy viewing, yet emerges as compulsively watchable.",3/5
12302,Red Rock West,"Red Rock West is a roller-coaster ride of a film, designed for those who like their thrillers spiced with the unexpected.",3/4
12303,Red Scorpion,The movie's reflective moments belong to Mr. Lundgren's sweaty chest.,2/5
12304,Red Sparrow,"Overall, if you're a fan of the spy genre, there's a lot to like in Red Sparrow. If you're like me, however, you may be left wanting a bit more.",3/5
12305,Red State,Frustratingly inconsistent.,5/10
12306,Red Trees,The banality of Marina Willer's voiceover only goes to prove the old clich that a picture is worth a thousand words.,2.5/4
12307,Red Trousers: The Life of the Hong Kong Stuntmen,"The great documentary about Hong Kong stuntmen, and their relationship to the Beijing Opera, still needs to be made.",2/4
12308,Red White & Blue,"An excellent, albeit harrowing piece of work featuring a standout performance from Noah Taylor.",9/10
12309,Redacted,"Despite De Palma's honorable intent and film's experimental nature, Redacted is an artistic disappointment, structurally messy, stereotypical in characters and lacking fresh insights about Iraq as particular war; helmer did better with Casualties of War.",C
12310,Redbelt,Chiwetel Ejiofor's powerful performance as a jiu-jitsu instructor steeped in the virtues of honor anchors David Mamet's intriguing film,B+
12311,Redemption Road,"There isn't a moment in Redemption Road when you feel like walking out; nor do you take the finished film with you. It's a solid piece of work, recycled to a degree, but satisfying.",B
12312,Redline,Redline is a direct-to-knucklehead release that refuses to bow out gracefully.,F
12313,Redline,"Redline doesn't boast much of a high-art story or clever dialogue, but the animation, stylistics and tone are art and visual stimuli at their very best.",8/10
12314,Reds,"Not as good as it thinks, but powerful filmmaking all the same",4/5
12315,Redwood Highway,"A road-trip movie that takes its time, with an enjoyable ramble through the beautiful woods of southern Oregon, 'Redwood Highway' is a character study of a determined, if sometimes perplexed, woman.",3/4
12316,I'm Reed Fish,"Napoleon Dynamite behind the microphone, Fish puts his life on the silver screen.",7/10
12317,Reefer Madness (Tell Your Children) (Doped Youth),Campy and just plain awful.,1.5/5
12318,Reel Injun,"For Diamond, Reel Injun is a highly personal odyssey, undertaken in an attempt to reconcile the realities of his native childhood with the natives he saw portrayed on screen.",3.5/5
12319,Reel Paradise,"Reel Paradise has all the feel of a labor of love -- about a labor of love. It's funny, heartfelt, gripping.",4/5
12320,The Ref,"This film introduced me, nay, introduced everyone, to the reason why Denis Leary is well regarded.",5/5
12321,The Reflecting Pool,"Whether or not you accept the revisionist view that 9/11 was in part a U.S. government conspiracy, this film is worth your reflection.",B
12322,Reflections in a Golden Eye,The surprise murder tops off the nutty story with a real bang.,A-
12323,Reform School Girls,"A great idea for a trailer or a poster, but not for a feature-length film.",1/5
12324,Refuge,"[...] Refuge's true effectiveness lies in Ritter's distinctively non-angelic performance. It's the work of a woman who knows she's been dealt a bad hand, but can't bring herself to leave the game.",3.5/5
12325,Regarding Henry,"This is a film of obvious and shallow contrivance, which aims without apology for easy emotional payoffs, and tries to manipulate the audience with plot twists that belong in a sitcom.",2/4
12326,ReGeneration,America's current ethical vacuum: How did we get this way? Why did the hippies think they'd change the world? And why are today's youths mainly relegating their lesser Utopian fantasies to those realizable with daddy's credit card?,9/10
12327,Regression,The exploration of whether regression therapy reveals buried memories or implants false ones is cheapened by a succession of dumb clues as to what is - disappointingly as it turns out - really going on.,2/5
12328,Reign of Fire,The two leads chomp considerably more scenery with their acting than fire-breathing monsters barbecue with their breath...,2.5/4
12329,Reign Over Me,The good news is that this is one-half of a terrific film. The bad news is that Adam Sandler is in the other half.,3/5
12330,Reincarnated,The whole thing ends up feeling like a superficial cross between a starstruck version of Vice's gonzo travelogues and a highly (ahem) stage-managed portrait of an artist in transition.,2/5
12331,Reindeer Games (Deception),The ho-hum thrills and coincidental mystery of these Games will likely leave you shrugging with indifference on the way out the door.,2.5/5
12332,The Reivers,"The Reivers is a pleasant, wholesome, straightforward movie of the sort (as they say) they don't make anymore.",3/4
12333,Rejoice & Shout,Rejoice and Shout is a rousing documentary that should really be required viewing for all music lovers and for anyone who would like to be in the know about the gospel genre.,4/5
12334,Relative Values,"The lightweight comedy remains undemanding, but offers some droll Brit humor that might satisfy the Anglophiles.",C
12335,Relentless,...director William Lustig tries his best to infuse the movie with a decent amount of style.,2/4
12336,The Relic,Gore seekers need only to know the body count is high and the scares are cheap as director Peter Hyams shares his beast's repellent disregard for human life.,2/4
12337,Relic,"A bone-chilling and devastating depiction of dementia. What begins as a more straightforward yet psychological approach to haunted house fare explodes into full-blown horror in a wholly unexpected way, and Relic marks one audacious debut.",4.5/5
12338,Religulous,"Religulous is no model for journalistic excellence, but it probably needn't be. It is more an opportunity for Maher to showcase his competent comic delivery than to win hearts and minds.",42/100
12339,The Remains of the Day,There is not a false note in the movie.,5/5
12340,ReMastered: The Two Killings of Sam Cooke,The fact that it accomplishes so much in less than 90 minutes is a testament to the love and respect Cooke still inspires.,B
12341,Nightwatching,"...the dialogue's hyper-intensity is the whole point, and Greenaway frames it with a heavy reliance on set design, rather than his usual use of overlapping images.",3/4
12342,Remember,"Remember features director Atom Egoyan and actor Christopher Plummer operating at the top of their games, delivering an intriguing revenge tale.",9/10
12343,Remember the Daze,This movie isn't even sophomoric; it's freshmanic.,1.5/4
12344,Remember the Titans,I'd hate to fathom a film community dominated by Bruckheimer material.,1.5/5
12345,Rememory,It's maudlin and confused-ultimately hampered by the poisonous pairing of cliches and self-importance.,1.5/5
12346,Remo Williams - The Adventure Begins,The adventure begins...and ends painfully.,1/5
12347,Renaissance,Looks fascinating but never quite springs to life.,2.5/5
12348,Renaissance Man,"Renaissance Man is a labored, unconvincing comedy that seems cobbled together out of the half-understood remnants of its betters.",1.5/4
12349,Rendition,"Hot off the headlines and onto the screen, this is a rarity -- a political film that delivers its timely message with a cinematic punch and no undue speechifying.",3.5/4
12350,Renegade,"As it gets more spiritual and internal, it makes less and less sense.",2.5/5
12351,Reno 911!: Miami,You are in for some good laughs!,2/4
12352,Renoir,An exquisite and sense-luscious French film about the great artist and his last muse.,5/5
12353,Rent-A-Pal,"'Rent-A-Pal' projects the anguish of being stuck living a life you never chose, but squanders more emotive bursts of horror when the film's finale follows a predictable pattern.",2.5/5
12354,Rent-A-Cop,"Rent-A-Cop is a collision between a relationship and a cliche, and the cliche wins, but not before the relationship has given us some nice moments.",2/4
12355,Repentance,The Silence of the Butler!,1.5/4
12356,The Replacement Killers,"Unfortunately, ""The Replacement Killers"" isn't a film by John Woo.",2/4
12357,The Replacements,The football games are a hoot.,4/5
12358,Replicant,"The whole trying affair is irresistibly dopey. Kinetic, too.",2/4
12359,Replicas,"Replicas is an insane tale directed without a fixed direction that is more comical than tragic, intelligent or, already less, interesting. [Full Review in Spanish]",1.5/5
12360,Repo Man,"Deadpan humor, throwaway visual jokes, and oblique political and social satire may have doomed this way-cool flick to the neverland of sci-fi cultdom.",9/10
12361,Repo! The Genetic Opera,Repo! The Genetic Opera is the real deal: a fiercely original sideshow freak-out of killer tunes and bloody mayhem unlike anything you've ever seen!,4.5/5
12362,Repossessed,BAD wanna-be comedy. Really lame.,1/5
12363,Reprisal,"Dull ""action diva in winter"" manhunt thriller, with Willis as second banana.",1.5/4
12364,The Reptile,Better than average -- and often overlooked -- Hammer opus.,3/5
12365,Reptilicus,Hysterically bad,1/5
12366,The Republic of Love,Mehta's confidently crafted film is more intelligent and serious than your standard romantic comedy.,81/100
12367,Repulsion,"The beauty of this film is that as it carries us along we see how Carole's every reaction makes sense, even whilst occasional glimpses through the eyes of others show clearly that she has completely lost it.",4.5/5
12368,Requiem for a Dream,Mr. Aronofsky draws astonishing performances from his actors.,4.5/5
12369,Requiem For The American Dream,"It's a dire history lesson, but the speaker remains phlegmatic -- he's no Michael Moore -- and leaves viewers with the sense that something can still be done about it.",3/4
12370,Rescue Dawn,It's very exciting to have Herzog nearly back on form as a feature filmmaker after his string of doc successes.,3/5
12371,The Rescuers Down Under,"Carries its ambitions with an easy grace, expanding the art of animation to fresh ground without losing sight of the silly fun we love cartoons for.",A
12372,Reservation Road,"...while the film is consistently entertaining, it never quite packs the emotional wallop that one might've hoped for...",2.5/4
12373,Reservoir Dogs,"A nod to such noir crime classics as Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing,"" the movie's more than savvy sensationalism. Suspense, horror and humor are expertly interwoven.",5/5
12374,Reset (Relève: Histoire d'une création),Dance aficionados will watch Reset to discover why Benjamin Millepied's time as director of dance at the Paris Opera Ballet was so brief.,3/5
12375,Reset,"For someone who used to work as a lab researcher, Yang's character puts to shame Liam Neeson's former CIA agent in Taken.",2.5/5
12376,Resident Evil,A monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it.,C+
12377,Resident Evil: Afterlife,"A dreadful bore that only occasionally comes to life. Even then, it's still a tedious mess of half-realized ideas, guided by a filmmaker who really shouldn't be allowed to make movies in the first place.",D
12378,Resident Evil: Apocalypse,"Lives up (or down) to every possible expectation and is possibly the best trashy movie since...well, since the original 'Resident Evil'.",5/5
12379,Resident Evil: Damnation,Resident Evil: Damnation is the best Resident Evil film to-date.,7.8/10
12380,Resident Evil: Degeneration,"I imagine if you are a fan of the game, and to a lesser degree a fan of the films, you should enjoy this zombie splatterfest",3.5/5
12381,Resident Evil: Extinction,"With almost non-stop action, above average effects and enough bloodshed to calm your inner horror freak, it can be said that Extinction, dropkicks Apocalypse upside the head.",3/5
12382,Resident Evil: Retribution,"Lacks inventiveness in any single fibre of its being - and worse, it's dull.",1/5
12383,Resident Evil: The Final Chapter,"Loyal fans should find the conclusion of the Resident Evil series satisfactory, but audiences yet to be won over won't find anything new to sway them now.",2.5/5
12384,Resident Evil: Vendetta,"The film's stilted dialogue, relentless exposition and 'uncanny valley' animated performances prove far more unsettling than the virus-infected ghouls lurking in the shadows.",2/5
12385,Resistance,"It's a great idea, and the filmmaking is sensitive and complex, although it's never as exciting as it should be.",3/5
12386,Resistance,"Resistance is a gripping, heartbreaking remembrance of a dark historical chapter. Jesse Eisenberg has his career best performance as legendary French mime, Marcel Marceau.",3.5/5
12387,Resolution,A strangely tense and humorous meta-narrative about two friends experiencing weird goings-on at a remote cabin.,3.5/5
12388,Breathe,"[Laurent's]beautifully shot, radiantly acted and artistically made film...is in all other respects a burnished gem...",B+
12389,Restless,"Though decently shot and acted, Van Sant's romantic melodrama might be one of his simplest and most conventional films, lacking his personal signature.",C
12390,Restless City,"Mr. Dosunmu seems to have directed all his actors to pause before delivering lines, giving a languor to the film that comes to feel studied.",2.5/5
12391,Restrepo,Moving and extremely clear-sighted... will live long in the memory.,4.5/5
12392,Results,"Writer/director Andrew Bujalski has enough laughs and stamina in his narrative, although at times the flabby story seems to drift endlessly without much focus other than on ripped biceps and toned abs.",2.5/4
12393,Resurrect Dead: The Mystery of the Toynbee Tiles,Documentary subjects are seldom this mysterious.,4/5
12394,Resurrecting the Champ,"Another strong film from Lurie ... an endearing, crowd-pleasing drama.",8.5/10
12395,Retaliation (Romans),"There's substance in (Bloom's) performance that lifts ""Retaliation"" above its hammered-home metaphors.",2.5/4
12396,Retreat,"This is a neat, well-crafted three-hander, making good use of its location; it really is a meaty role for Bell, who lets rip in what might be his most eye-catching part since Billy Elliot.",3/5
12397,The Return,"I've not witnessed a more torturously boring, convoluted, and eye-wateringly moronic chiller this year.",F
12398,Return of the Blind Dead (El Ataque de los muertos sin ojos) (Return of the Evil Dead),It's only a matter of time before the film reverts to the pattern of poorly established characters coming to grisly ends.,C
12399,Return of the Secaucus Seven,"a peculiarly literate lack of focus indicative of a brilliant novelist moonlighting, at this point, as a filmmaker.",2/4
12400,Return,"A modest, intimate, not particularly engaging American indie (premiering in Cannes Fest) about the adjustment problems of a woman who returns from a tour of duty overseas.",B-
12401,Return from Witch Mountain,asinine,1.5/5
12402,The Return of a Man Called Horse,"If this seems a little thin for a two-hour movie, believe me, it is, even with all that portentous music trying to make it seem momentous.",2/4
12403,The Return of Frank James,"The film is short on action but long on courtroom melodrama, not a good balance for a routine Western.",B-
12404,The Return of Swamp Thing,Not since King Kong and Godzilla first slugged it out atop Mount Fuji has there been a more laughable -- or more ludicrous -- man-in-a-monster-suit movie.,1.5/4
12405,Return of the Dragon (The Way of the Dragon),"Strip down the excess of strange characters and bizarre humour, and you have Bruce: mesmerising, fast, witty, and one of the rare examples of true screen magnetism.",4/5
12406,Return of the Fly,removes most of the romantic melodrama that characterized the first film and replaces it with a plot involving criminal intrigue and revenge-inspired murder,2.5/4
12407,Return of the Killer Tomatoes!,Still more tomato gore from the ridiculous rolling tomatoes.,1/5
12408,The Return of the Living Dead,"It's kind of a sensation-machine, made out of the usual ingredients, and the real question is whether it's done with style. It is.",3/4
12409,Return of the Living Dead Part II,"The first film was an amusing, winking zombiefest that glorified its own cheekiness. The sequel tries to do bigger and better and thus is less and worse.",2/5
12410,Return of the Living Dead 3,embarrassingly funny,3/5
12411,The Return of the Pink Panther,"Sellers' return (to the series) was a triumph, so much so that the actor would complete two more ""Panther"" films before his untimely death.",7/10
12412,Return of the Seven,An absolute waste.,0/5
12413,Return to Hardwick,"A documentary like this reminds us of ""The Good War,"" the sacrifices it took to fight it, but also the horizon-broadening adventure of it all for a generation of Americans who got their first taste of the big, wide world in khaki.",2.5/4
12414,Return to House on Haunted Hill,"Most of it is standard fright-flick fare, with almost no emphasis on the fright.",4/10
12415,Return to Me,A delightful surprise.,B+
12416,Return to Never Land,"This is Disney trying to pull the wool over our eyes, this time bringing their straight-to-video sequel to the big screen.",2/4
12417,Return to Nuke 'Em High,Paredes and Corcoran give really sincere performances. You really believe the relationship that forms between Chrissy and Lauren and it's legitimately touching. They are also adorable doing the ridiculous Troma gags.,7.5/10
12418,Return to Sender,"The camera prowls menacingly through the interiors, but the writers seem too content with their improbable conceit to bother with back story or character arcs.",2/5
12419,Return to the Blue Lagoon,"The sincere idiocy of this film really has to be seen to be appreciated -- not that I think there is any need for you to see, or appreciate, it.",1.5/4
12420,Reuniting The Rubins,"As dysfunctional movie families go, the Rubins hardly linger in the memory.",2/5
12421,They Came Back,"A creative and intelligent recycling of the dead returning for non-horror purposes, but it runs into pacing problems toward the middle.",6/10
12422,Revenge,"An astonishing, subversive take on tired clichés.",10/10
12423,The Revenge of Frankenstein,There was a staid quality about the film that kept it from being as gripping as it could have been.,B-
12424,Revenge of the Creature,This series went to crap faster than Freddy Krueger's.,1/5
12425,Revenge of the Electric Car,An important subject with mass appeal. Read my full review.,3.5/5
12426,Revenge of the Green Dragons,Like a bad episode of 21 Jump Street.,1/10
12427,Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise,"If the filmmakers had possessed an ounce of imagination, they would have invested the Tri-Lambs with true nerd-dom, and then watched them try to overcome their nerdy tendencies.",1.5/4
12428,The Revenge of the Pink Panther,"Some people say that the Pink Panther films just got more ridiculous as they went along. Well, so be it. This movie proves that inflatable parrots are just as funny as dead ones. A classic and sadly the last real Closeau film. Recommended.",4/5
12429,Revenger,Revenger spends too much time on forgettable characters and misguided plot points.,2.5/5
12430,Reverb,"Early scenes, when strange sounds fill the studio and a phone keeps ringing, are creepy enough - but when a hidden message is detected on a track, the film crumbles from tinnitus.",2/10
12431,Reversal of Fortune,"The seesaw of uncertainty about Claus' actions is the fulcrum of Reversal of Fortune, Barbet Schroeder's intermittently brilliant take on a bizarre, sad relationship played out in the grand but chilly halls of Newport.",B+

12435,Revolutionary Road,"Though boasting strong, Oscar-caliber turns from DiCaprio, Winslet, and Michael Shannon, Mendes' second dissection of suburbia is too studied and deliberate in the first acts before generating emotional power, and may suffer in comparison to TV's Mad Men.",B+
12436,Revolver,"Any semblance of a cohesive narrative arc is junked early on, and those who can sit through Revolver and claim to have ""followed it completely"" is a bald-faced liar.",1.5/5

12443,Richard Jewell,Easily director Clint Eastwood's best film since 2006's Letters from Iwo Jima.,4/5
12444,Richard Linklater: Dream Is Destiny,"What Dream is Destiny makes clear is that commercial success really isn't everything, and that being a director who isn't bothered by it can lead to a singular if perhaps undervalued career.",3/5
12445,Richard Pryor Here and Now,"At the end of the movie we have been wrung out with laughter -- and with a few other things, too, because Pryor is more than a comedian in this film: He's a social commentator, and a man talking honestly about himself.",4/4
12446,Richard Pryor---Live in Concert,Anybody who thinks Eddie Murphy is funny should watch this and discover where he stole his act.,5/5
12447,Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip,"Sheer, breathtaking brilliance. A must-see.",5/5
12448,Richard Pryor: Omit The Logic,"As a showcase of Pryor's talent and influence, Omit the Logic is undeniably fun. It just feels a little slight given the massive cultural influence of its subject matter.",3/5

12467,Riding in Cars With Boys,Penny Marshall's panache for deftly mixing humor with pain prevents Riding in Cars from becoming too mawkish a cautionary tale.,2.5/4

12475,Ring of Fire,"Ring of Fire is a better than average Lifetime movie that will leave viewers hand-clapping, singing along and maybe sniffling a little.",2.5/4
12476,The Ring Two,"Provides one or two jumps and they're suitably creative, but they don't represent the film as a whole which is, in short, a mess.",37/100
12477,Ringmaster,"Beyond the generally inane concept and the fact that it's nothing more than a longer, unedited and somewhat ""fictitious"" look at the show, the film's biggest fault is that it's neither funny nor outrageous enough to make it even close to being worthwhile.",0/10
12478,Rings,"If you were wondering how a movie series about a killer VHS tape would transition from the analog age to the digital age, keep wondering.",1.5/4

12495,Rise of the Guardians,"All style and no substance, Rise of the Guardians' gorgeous visual presentation boasts a lot more dimension than its underwhelming script.",2.5/5
12496,Rise of the Legend (Huang feihong zhi yingxiong you meng ),"Taiwanese heart-throb Peng is certainly well cast as the slicker and more hunky Wong -- his signature bad-boy smirk is always at the ready and his famous abs are, gasp, on full display in several scenes.",3/5
12497,Rise of the Planet of the Apes,I realise that action movies aren't meant to be realistic but these characters needed to be far more interesting and believable if they were going to draw me in.,C
12498,Risen,"The feature is far too sluggish to crack open the spirit. Still, Reynolds is an inspired choice, finding intermittent success with a resurrection mystery.",C+
12499,Rising From Ashes,An inspirational illustration of how the Olympics came to serve as a unifying step in terms of exorcising the demons ever haunting Rwanda's grisly killing fields.,3/4
12500,Rising High (Betonrausch),"It's a bit like a Brit geezer-caper film in some ways, and, like so many of those, sounds as though it is based on a hundred urban myths and friend-of-a-friend anecdotes. What makes it more than just that is Kross...",3/5

12503,Riten (The Rite) (The Ritual),Definitely not a film for everyone.,2/4
12504,Kinyarwanda,"The film is not just a wrenching history lesson about how easily riven a nation can become. It is also a moving tale about the struggle of Rwandans to stitch their country back together, to find a way to forgive as well as ask forgiveness.",3/4

12506,Rites of Spring,"Padraig Reynolds's film has no interest in self-awareness, and in fact wears stupidity as a sort of badge of honor.",0/4
12507,The Ritz,"The Ritz never quite succeeds. Its ambition is clearly to be a screwball comedy in the tradition of the 1930s classics and such recent attempts as What's Up, Doc? and Silent Movie. But it lacks the manic pacing, and the material grows thin",2.5/4

12514,Rivers and Tides: Andy Goldsworthy Working With Time,A mesmerizing movie that is so incredibly tranquil and uniquely lovely that it is an artistic creation itself.,3.5/4

12530,Road to Singapore,Hope and Crosby still a bit rough around the edges.,3/5

12536,Roar,"There's really not much going on with Roar storywise. But then you take a step back and think about what it is that you're watching. My viewing of Roar was set to a soundtrack of ""Oh my God!"" and ""Holy crap!"", all of my own making.",4/5

12544,Robin Hood,"While it's true that this Robin Hood is unlike any you've seen before, it's also one that you may not want to see again.",C+
12545,Robin Hood,"Everything is overwrought, but attitude can only go so far. The action, effects and antics are meaningless without just a bit of originality in the script.",2/5
12546,Robin Hood: Men in Tights,"Maybe [Brooks thinks he's] catching those Naked Gun/Hot Shots whippersnappers at their own game. Sadly, no.",2/5
12547,Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a murky, unfocused, violent and depressing version of the classic story, with little of the lightheartedness and romance we expect from Robin Hood.",2/4

12569,Rocket Science,"For all its quirky characterizations, semi-clever dialogue and convention-defying plot contortions, Rocket Science is a fairly schizophrenic affair.",3.5/5
12570,Rocket Singh - Salesman of the Year,"Sporadically amusing, but it often drags and feels contrived and dull while suffering from an uneven balance of comedy, drama, romance and social criticism.",4.75/10
12571,The Rocketeer,"Okay special effects, but the story tends to drag and ultimately the most interesting thing in it is sumptuous Jennifer Connelly's cleavage.",2.5/4

12618,Romero,"The film's weakness is a certain implacable predictability: We can feel at every moment what must happen next, and the over-all trajectory of the film seems ordained even in the first few shots. As a result, the film doesn't stir many passions.",2.5/4
12619,Romper Stomper,"While the film often draws comparisons to A Clockwork Orange, Romper Stomper doesn't carry the gravity that the Malcolm McDowell classic does.",3/5
12620,"Romulus, My Father","For all its sad moments, Romulus, My Father is a love story between father and son kept aloft by unalloyed admiration.",3.5/5

12622,Rondo,"This low-budget thriller is worth a view, once you lower your expectations a dozen notches.",6/10
12623,Ronin,Ronin is a generally familiar if murky and occasionally pretentious exercise.,2/4
12624,Rookie of the Year,"This movie is not likely to make my list of the year's best, but I can remember those miserable Little League games and so in a modest way I'm grateful for this film. It is pure wish-fulfillment, 40 years after I needed it.",3/4
12625,Room,Abrahamson seamlessly translates Donaghue's work into cinematic terms.,A-
12626,Room 237,"Hopefully Ascher will continue this trend by examining all the hidden tricks, gimmicks and stylings of other brain-twisting cinematic treats as they can provide genuine insight into the work of a director. Even if it's all just nonsense.",3/4
12627,Room 6,Room 6 is so repetitive in its gotcha fright tactics that it soon downgrades from mildly scary to silly to wholly absurd.,1.5/5
12628,Room For Rent,"In all honesty, there's not a lot of deep laughs. But Room for Rent is a funny, light comedy that stays a step ahead of the audience. It's solid story and with solid performances worth checking out.",3.5/5
12629,Room for Rent,"Room for Rent has all the right pieces to be a great thriller, but it fails to deliver on its promise.",5/10
12630,Roommates,"The pieces were in place for a nice little story, but by trying to do too much with it, Roommates overshoots the runway.",2.5/4
12631,Rooster Cogburn,"The whole movie seems so contrived, so obviously a vehicle for its stars and for their former, happier roles, that finally we just get depressed. Talent shouldn't be thrown around like this.",1/4
12632,Rope,"It's a curiosity more than anything else, worth seeing once by fans of Hitchcock and film buffs in general, but not one that might appeal to everyone.",3/4
12633,Rory O'Shea Was Here,"Thanks to strong performances and some bracing one-liners, O'Donnell makes a convincing case for equality for disabled people in society, though casting able-bodied actors as his wheelchair-driving protagonists unavoidably weakens his argument.",4/5
12634,Rory Scovel Tries Stand-up For The First Time,"Weird is wonderful, as [Rory] Scovel has proven time and again throughout his career, but that means creating new structures to showcase it, not relying on the scaffolding that already exists.",6.9/10
12635,Rose Marie,"Rose Marie (1936) is the film with the best-remembered pairing of ""America's Singing Sweethearts.""",A
12636,The Rose Tattoo,"Anna Magnani shines ... but the stagebound feel of the film, and especially some wretched overacting by Burt Lancaster, almost sink it.",2.5/5
12637,Roseanne for President!,Ragtag though fairly amusing ...,2.5/4
12638,Rosemary's Baby,...the humor in no way minimizes the film's ability to frighten and unnerve us.,9/10
12639,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,"A mess, but a damn amusing one.",4/5
12640,Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead,Displays both sharp literary intelligence and tongue-in-cheek pop silliness.,4/5

12642,Rosewater,"Imagine a rousing ""Daily Show"" episode without the jokes.",C+
12643,Rosewood,Neither the film's smug white bigots nor its uniformly noble blacks are well served by such oversimplification.,2.5/4
12644,Rough Night,Rough Night didn't rewrite the book and it's often thoroughly silly. But it's also - like hen's nights are supposed to be but never are - a lot of fun.,3/5
12645,'Round Midnight,"You do not need to know a lot about jazz to appreciate what is going on because, in a certain sense, this movie teaches you everything about jazz that you really need to know.",4/4
12646,Roustabout,Better than average Elvis vehicle.,3/5
12647,Roving Mars,"Based on actual photos the rovers continue to buzz back to planet Earth, the CGI landscapes are impressive but the camera maneuvers are ungodly.",2/4
12648,Roxanne,"All of the corners of this movie have been filled with small, funny moments.",3.5/4
12649,Roxanne Roxanne,Gets by on the swagger of newcomer Chante Adams' furious performance and its immersion into the style and culture of hip-hop,3/5
12650,Roxie Hart,Rogers seemed lost.,2.5/5
12651,Royal Wedding,Mostly I sat amazed at Astaire's dancing.,3.5/5

12653,Ruby Bridges,"Ruby is an inspiring and cute little girl. The film revisits a shameful past and shows what a powerful force moral fortitude can be, even in a child.",73/100
12654,Ruby Sparks,"""Ruby Sparks"" is a humorous observation of the dysfunctional ground between men and women, especially during the early stages of a relationship. It has ""date-movie"" written all over it.",B
12655,Rudderless,"Crudup is as good as it gets when playing impaired, almost always making choices that are unexpected and manage to be funny without minimizing the depth of intoxication.",B+
12656,Rudo y Cursi,Gael García Bernal and Diego Luna reunite in Rudo y Cursi to denigrate rubes from Jalisco as slow-witted provincial brothers and banana plantation workers whose unlikely rise to soccer stardom supplies the purported comedy.,1/4
12657,Rudolph and Frosty: Christmas in July,"Dark, creepy story lacks Yuletide spirit.",1/5
12658,Rudy,"Astin's performance is so self-effacing, so focused and low-key, that we lose sight of the underdog formula and begin to focus on this dogged kid who won't quit. And the last big scene is an emotional powerhouse, just the way it's supposed to be.",3.5/4
12659,Rugrats Go Wild,Rugrats Go Wild! successfully exploits a series of run-ins between the two clans.,2.5/4
12660,Rugrats in Paris - The Movie,"Despite its hackneyed premise, the plot has a few imaginative twists, and the pack of Japanese sumo-wrestler waiters who grunt out a karaoke version of Bad Girls are a riot.",3/5
12661,The Rugrats Movie,It's a great film. Go see it. Go enjoy it. Don't forget the kids.,4/5
12662,Ruin Me,It's DeFrancis' feature debut and will certainly succeed in getting him noticed.,3/5
12663,Rules Don't Apply,"If its somewhat unfocused narrative comes at the cost at a picture that could be more cohesive and concise, it still gifts viewers with characters and an era that's entertaining to explore.",B
12664,The Rules of Attraction,Trick photography and a merry go roundelay of trysts make this a strong film despite its redundancies.,3/4
12665,Rules of Engagement,"Rules of Engagement isn't a bad film, but it's one that is often too dramatically and intellectually inert to warrant a full recommendation.",2.5/4
12666,Rumble Fish,"A seminal work in teen films, shot appropriately in B/W (except for the fish).",B+
12667,Rumble in the Bronx,"Despite the picture's numerous shortcomings, Rumble in the Bronx still packs more laughs and inventive action than most of Hollywood's jaded action product.",3/5

12669,Rumor Has It,"Even if it never quite jumps out of the tried-and-true mould, the sharp cast and clever script spice things up.",3.5/5
12670,Run for Cover,"Ray endows it with his usual themes of generational conflict and societal injustice, and does a powerful job getting these themes across.",A
12671,Run All Night,"Liam Neeson delivers afresh in an edge-of-your-seat, high body-count thriller every bit as good as they come!",4/4

12679,Run the Tide,"Both the film and its star, Taylor Lautner, ore more scenic than dramatic.",1.5/4
12680,Run This Town,"Tollman manages to pull a muscular dark comedy from all this horrid behaviour. The debut writer/director shows off the confidence, skill and style we saw in Jason Reitman's Thank You For Smoking.",3/5
12681,Run with the Hunted,"Some of the film's narrative threads are frustratingly unresolved, while others are wrapped up in arbitrary fashion.",1.5/4

12684,Runaway Train,Runaway Train belongs to a rare genre: the intelligent thriller.,3.5/4
12685,Rundskop (Bullhead),Take a chance and you will be rewarded with a work of nightmarish force that is unforgettable.,3/4
12686,Runner Runner,"Justin Timberlake and Ben Affleck give their best poker faces but ultimately fail to convince you to gamble your cash away on this limp, unoriginal story of a man out of his depth.",2/5
12687,Runnin' Down a Dream: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,"Employs a warm and leisurely, though never sluggish, pace that's upfront about Bogdanovich's intention to take his sweet time tackling every topic of relevant interest.",3/4
12688,Running From Crazy,The only new titbit of information for Hemingway-philes is that none of his grandchildren read his books.,3/5
12689,The Running Man,The movie's problem is that all of the action scenes are versions of the same scenario.,2.5/4
12690,Running on Empty,"These are people who have made a choice and are living with the consequences, and during the course of the film they will have to re-evaluate their decisions.",4/4
12691,Running With Scissors,"If you can appreciate the film as a series of quirky vignettes, without the depth needed to inspire and uplift, then there is plenty to enjoy here.",3.5/5
12692,Running with the Devil,"There's nothing necessarily wrong opting to not name these characters, but boy does it really add to the blank slate of nothingness they all are",1/5
12693,Runoff,"Runoff's finely-observed, understated performances invoke a kind of heartland neo-realism.",B+
12694,Rupture,"Too much time is spent sneaking aimlessly around the building. And when the B-movie reveal finally comes into focus, it feels like a waste of a good set-up.",3/5
12695,Rush,"Aided by two punchy lead turns, an Oscar-worthy script and stunning in-car footage, Howard's race film delivers top-gear drama. A piston- and heart-pumping triumph.",5/5
12696,Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage,"Aficionados will be gripped, while those not attracted to the sounds will be charmed by the characters.",3/5
12697,Rush Hour,"Tucker's sole focus, a la Groucho Marx, is on what's directly in front of him - and that attitude only reinforces the cruddiness of a vehicle like Rush Hour. The film isn't worth giving a damn about either.",C-
12698,Rush Hour 2,"I wanted more excitement, more character dimension, and a whole hell of a lot less of Chris Tucker's irritating mouth.",3/5
12699,Rush Hour 3,The cinematic equivalent of a third-generation photocopy of a doodle barely worth a glance in the first place.,1/6
12700,Rushlights,"If ever a movie signaled that the Quentin Tarantino copycat age of empty-headed wink-wink genre rehashing is still with us, ""Rushlights"" is that movie.",1/5
12701,Rushmore,"Rushmore as a film exists out of time and place, locked into a vaguely Sixties-ish groove that's only heightened by Schwartzman's dank locks and Anderson's choice of a uniformly British Invasion soundtrack.",4/5
12702,Russell Mulcahy's Tale of the Mummy,Not bad but poor CGI muffles the scares.,3/5
12703,The Russia House,"To judge by this film, the life of a Cold War spy consists of sitting for endless hours in soundproof rooms with people you do not particularly like, waiting for something to happen. Sort of like being a movie critic.",2/4
12704,Russian Dolls (Les Poupées Russes),"Uma continuao no apenas dispensvel, mas que ainda consegue, em certo grau, diminuir nosso carinho pelo original.",3/5
12705,"The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming",...a disarming send-up of Cold War paranoia.,7/10
12706,Russkies,"I am enough of a realist to realize that adults probably had to come into this plot at one point or another, but the adults, unfortunately, bring grown-up movie cliches along with them, and that spoils some of the fun.",2.5/4
12707,Rust Creek,"A gripping indie thriller -- skillfully made, well-acted, and poignant in ways you don't anticipate.",3.5/4
12708,Rustlers' Rhapsody,Its one-note joke wore thin for me mighty soon.,C
12709,Ruthless People,"DeVito is the mainspring of Ruthless People, the engine of murderous intensity right at the center. His passion is so palpable that it adds weight to all the other performances in the movie.",3.5/4
12710,RV,Any correlation between this movie and human intelligence is purely coincidental.,1/10
12711,Ryan's Daughter,"A disappointing failure of tone, a lush and overblown self-indulgence in which David Lean has given us a great deal less than meets the eye.",2/4
12712,S. Darko: A Donnie Darko Tale,"It's a spineless, careless, bizarrely unadventurous number two that would rather saddle up and rehash Kelly's original screenplay over any clear-cut attempt to cook up some juicy oddities of its own.",D-
12713,S&Man,A darkly insightful and entirely fascinating study of the most disturbing material out there ... and why we like to watch it.,4/5
12714,V/H/S/2,"The four ""tapes"" in S-VHS provide a diverse series of horror short films, but their potential is squandered by the film's overall, disappointing plot, which is a weak-attempted framing device.",5/10
12715,Saban's Power Rangers,Overall the film will be a big hit with the ten and under crowd. The thirty minutes of training montages and robotics are just exciting enough to detract from the weak storyline.,2.5/5
12716,Sabotage,"Sabotage is unusually dark and serious for a Schwarzenegger vehicle, but the star doesn't quite have the acting chops to pull off the moral gray areas.",2.5/5
12717,Saboteur,"The movie has its enjoyable, even humorous moments, but the brooding sense of danger and fear so prominent in his other films, are more noticeably absent.",3/5
12718,Sabretooth,"In the realm of straight-to-video horror, you could certainly do worse than Sabretooth. The film would probably best be enjoyed among friends, with copious amounts of booze handy.",2.5/4
12719,Sacco and Vanzetti,"Even those of us familiar with the case will find fresh insights into a crime and punishment that is, still, wrought with controversy.",B+

12721,Sacred Stage: The Mariinski Theater,Splendid.,4/5
12722,The Saddest Music in the World,"As delirious and idiosyncratic as Maddin's past works, The Saddest Music in the World benefits from more robust pacing, greater narrative coherence and less preciousness overall.",4/5
12723,The Sadist,The Sadist gets a lot of bang for its dollar.,B-
12724,Safe,Director and writer Todd Haynes does a great job of leaving the cause of Carol's disorder open for debate.,4/5
12725,Safe,"The theme seems to be 'a man's redemption,' but this is merely an excuse for little more than a filmed shooting gallery.",C-
12726,Safe Haven,Will satisfy those with a fluffy romantic sweet tooth while the rest will likely suffer from indigestion.,2/5
12727,Safe House,"Safe House plays out just like a romantic comedy, only with slightly more explosions, car chases, hand-cuffings, ear-yankings and stabbings with glass shards.",3/4
12728,Safe Men,"Safe Men whirls wildly from one bright idea to the next, trying to find a combo that will hold the movie together. No luck.",1/4
12729,Safelight,"Bland mismatched lovers drama that benefits from striking locations, decent cast and a tone of exhausted resignation.",2/4
12730,Safety Last!,"Impossible to watch without undergoing visitations of vertigo, Safety Last's climactic sequence is all it's reputed to be.",5/5
12731,Safety Not Guaranteed,"An oddly effective little charmer, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" ekes out a victory over so much of its indie-darling competition simply by following through on the ideas it introduces.",B-
12732,Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation,Sagrada plays like a video you might buy at the cathedral gift shop that outlines the history of the project.,2/5
12733,The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea,Highly disturbing film...,3/5
12734,The Saint,A piece of mass-market movie bubblegum that stretches incredulity and then snaps apart.,2/4
12735,Saint Misbehavin': The Wavy Gravy Movie,"Esrick spent 10 years on the film, and the result is a comprehensive portrait.",3/4
12736,Saint Frances,"With charming performances, Saint Frances is a small little indie film from Chicago that manages to tackle some serious issues.",4/5
12737,Saint Jack,One wishes it were more outrageous and less knowing.,2/5
12738,Saint John of Las Vegas,Saint John of Las Vegas marches in lockstep with virtually every cliche of the modern independent film.,2/4
12739,Saint Laurent,We can never have too many scenes of half-naked beautiful people spaced out in slo-mo to Giorgio Morodor-like music.,8.5/10
12740,Saints and Soldiers,"Warmed over Norman Mailer tales -- been there, done that.",54/100
12741,Salem's Lot,"Although this movie is old, and was made with minimal effects, it is still creepy - much more so than any contemporary vampire story or overblown CGI ghost tale.",4/5
12742,Salesman,"a stark, indelible cinematic portrait of the trials and tribulations of the door-to-door salesman, a profession that is virtually extinct today",3.5/4
12743,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,Trying to get audiences to root for whether fish will swim upstream is often an easier task than getting them to care about whether the two leads will hook up.,6/10
12744,Salome's Last Dance,"Despite the fact that Salome's Last Dance encompasses almost the entire text of a play by Wilde, it seems shapeless and without purpose.",2/4
12745,Salon Kitty (Edited Version),"[A] failure, although with some very interesting moments.",4/10
12746,Salt of the Earth,"Unavoidable classic on a 1950 mine strike, made by McCarthy era blacklisted filmmakers.",5/5
12747,The Salton Sea,It's a sharp movie about otherwise dull subjects.,3.5/5
12748,Saludos Amigos,"A colorful combination of life action, animation and Latin music. A pioneering effort by Disney.",3/5
12749,Salvador,Salvador is long and disjointed and tries to tell too many stories... But the heart of the movie is fascinating.,3/4
12750,Salvage,It's a promising premise that soon gets stuck in a cul-de-sac.,2/5
12751,Salvation Army,Beautifully observed and melancholic,3/4
12752,Salvation Boulevard,"The performances are histrionic and abrasive, in what feels like a rushed production where no one had the time to come up with a unique spin on the material.",D+
12753,Salvo,There's lots to love about Salvo.,3/5
12754,Samaritan Girl (Samaria),A wholly unique tale that gives expressive voice to the pains of childhood and the parents forced to bear witness.,B+
12755,Samba,"""Samba"" is a love story set in a contemporary world brimming with immigration issues, but it manages to be neither political drama, nor bubbly romance, somehow getting away with being labeled as a comedy.",C-
12756,Same Boat,The laughs are few and far between in this travelogue/cruise ship misadventure that seems more promising as the starting point for a remake.,1.5/4
12757,Same Kind of Different As Me,"It can be hard to disagree with the heart and events of this true tale, except for when the movie reveals itself to be mighty self-congratulatory.",2/4
12758,Sami Blood,First-time filmmaker Amanda Kernell does a superb job of establishing the central character and her rural environs...,2/4
12759,Sammy's Adventures 2 (Sammy's avonturen 2),Sammy's Painfully Long Incarceration would be a better title for this sequel to 2010's A Turtle's Tale: Sammy's Adventures.,2/5
12760,Sample This,"The movie provides a vivid sense of the period, as well as an intriguing backstage look at the making of improbable pop classics.",3/4
12761,SamSam,"Plays like what it is, a quick and pretty, but ill-thought-through attempt to cash in on a popular French kids' cartoon.",1.5/4
12762,Samsara,An enthralling non-narrative documentary with images from five continents that becomes a guided meditation on the wheel of life and death; one of the best films of 2012 that you will treasure all your life.,5/5
12763,Samson,A respectful and heartfelt portrayal of a story whose power is undimmed over the millennia.,B-
12764,Samurai Marathon,A measured and intricate depiction of a timeless fight for honour and culture in ever-changing times. Well worth your time.,4/5
12765,San Andreas,"This is a film that knows what it is and makes no excuses, happily owning its more cringe worthy moments while standing proud by its action spectacle.",3/5
12766,San Francisco,The most interesting thing about this film was its phenomenal re-enactment of the San Francisco earthquake.,3/5
12767,Sanctum,"Suffocating, nerve-fraying and deeply uncomfortable to watch. Just not in the ways intended.",2/5
12768,Sand Castle,"An Iraq War combat picture that fails to surprise, generic in the extreme.",2/4
12769,Sand Dollars (Dolares de Arena),The movie stands out because the directors opt to show us situations that feel real instead of trying to dramatize everything to get a reaction from the audience. [Full review in Spanish],3.5/5

12776,Sangre De Mi Sangre,"In his impressive feature debut, Christopher Zalla blends successfully the conventions of a political thriller with those of a family melodrama, set against the context of two timely issues, illegal Mexican immigration and stolen identity.",B+
12777,Sanjuro (Tsubaki Sanjûrô),"Short and sweet. If you haven't seen Yojimbo, go rent that before this. If you haven't seen Seven Samurai, go rent that before Yojimbo. And once you've done those two, graduate to Sanjuro.",5/5
12778,Santa & Andrés,"Their eventual emotional, if not political, understanding is wonderfully portrayed by the actors and smartly delineated in the screenplay.",B+
12779,Santa Buddies,...immediately establishes itself as a pointless and downright interminable family comedy that's almost entirely lacking in elements designed to appeal to older viewers.,0.5/4
12780,Santa Claus Conquers the Martians,"The plot, such as it is, proves it is possible to insult the intelligence of a three-year-old.",1/5
12781,Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town,So overall it is an odd trippy little film but I enjoyed watching it.,8/10
12782,Santa Claus: The Movie,"Little kids will probably like most of this movie. The weakness is that larger kids and parents, deputized to escort the little ones, are likely to find a lot of it a little thin.",2.5/4
12783,The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause,"The pogo vibe of the first two films is missing from the new picture, but what it lacks in bellylaughs in makes up for in reliable entertainment value - an increasingly lost art.",B
12784,Santa Fe Trail,Revels in its inaccuracies.,B-

12788,The Saphead,Slightly amusing.,B-
12789,Saraband,"Ingmar Bergman has said that Saraband, his bleak made-for- television epilogue to Scenes From a Marriage, will be his final statement on film. For the great Swedish writer and director, final turns out to mean unbendingly severe.",4/5
12790,Sarafina!,This movie doesn't know what it believes.,2/4
12791,Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour,"Either flush with cash or in possession of incriminating photographs of a Freestyle Releasing executive, somehow this family pushed their tween mystery into a theatrical release this weekend, despite making a picture almost completely devoid of polish.",C-
12792,Sarah Silverman: Jesus Is Magic,"Even if the only place ""Jesus is Magic"" ever shows up is on HBO, it's worth your time to check the flick out.",4/5
12793,Sarah Silverman: We are Miracles,"The inimitable stamp of Silverman's dark, tart personality is again on rich display in her latest stand-up comedy offering.",B

12795,Sassy Pants,"Sassy Pants has a slightly ludic atmosphere akin to another tale of teen alienation, Dear Lemon Lima, but it unfolds like a fable in which only Bethany doesn't feel like a canned caricature.",2/4

12797,Satanic Panic,Satanic Panic is a delightful gore-fest that delivers side-splitting laughs horror fans will absolutely adore.,9.5/10
12798,Satan's Playground,"At the end of the day, Satan's Playground let me down, a fact that I attribute primarily to the bad acting, nonsensical storyline, and lack of an appearance by the monster.",2.5/5
12799,Saturday Church,Saturday Church is a racially and sexually diverse rumination on identity that defies simple definition in its low-key elegance.,8.9/10
12800,Saturday Night And Sunday Morning,"Not much fun, but an archetype of its genre.",3/5
12801,Saturday Night Fever,"There's a lot in the movie that's sad and painful, but after a few years what you remember is John Travolta on the dance floor in that classic white disco suit, and the Bee Gees on the soundtrack.",4/4

12807,Savage Sam,This 1963 sequel to Old Yeller is every bit as bad as the first movie was good.,4/10
12808,The Savages,"Jenkins makes a huge leap forward in her sophomore film, a serio comedy that effortlessly blends humor and pathos in a tale of a dysfunctional family in which the two misfit siblings are splendidly played by Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman.",B+
12809,Savages,The perfect Stone-r movie.,4/5
12810,Savannah,The film is impossible to take seriously as a commemoration of Moultrie's life or Allen's prolific status because of its plethora of contrivances.,0.5/4
12811,Save Me,A sensitive exploration of the motivations behind both the people conducting this dubious therapy and those seeking treatment.,3/4

12813,Save the Last Dance,"A formula fish out of water, dancer flick.",6/10
12814,Save the Tiger,Save the Tiger is essentially a virtuoso piece of movie acting. Jack Lemmon holds the movie together by the sheer force of his performance as Harry; he makes this character so convincing that we're fascinated.,3/4

12821,Saving Private Ryan,All in all a remarkable and yet very uneven film.,2.5/4
12822,Saving Santa,"Voiced by a recognisable cast, Saving Santa is a pleasant and well-timed festive animation, but its unsophisticated storyline, general lack of humour and substandard soundtrack ultimately let it down.",2/5
12823,Saving Silverman,"Pretty consistently funny, and that's about all one can ask from this kind of motion picture.",3/4
12824,Saving Zoë,Competent but stolid mystery thriller whose ladies/siblings -- the Marano sisters -- can't lift into something moving or special.,2/4

12844,Scared to Death,It is hard to believe -- even within the weird world of poverty row -- that this movie got this way by accident. It may just be that the film was meant to be an aburdist joke.,4/5

12867,School for Scoundrels,"Asked only to regurgitate prior performances, Heder dutifully performs his bumbling Napoleon Dynamite shtick and Thornton berates people with caustic Bad Santa/Bad News Bears nastiness.",1.5/4
12868,School Life (La vie scolaire),"If virtual education in the time of Covid-19 makes you nostalgic for the sight of students and teachers occupying actual classrooms, this Netflix import gives the inspiring teacher/at-risk youth drama a hard-ass and heartfelt French redo.",3/5
12869,School of Rock,Linklater and his actors understand passion. They understand enthusiasm.,4.5/5
12870,School Ties,"Still, tempting as it is to giggle at the retro-high-mindedness of School Ties, the movie is nicely acted, and it has been made with some honesty and intelligence.",B

12872,Scoob!,"Not so much a continuation of the stories audiences have seen, but a soft-reboot that opens the door for an entire Hanna-Barbera universe of adventures, Scoob! is a fun tale of loving friendship ...",4/5

12997,Set It Off,"Overlong, overdone and overwrought, the narratively challenged Set It Off gets off on exploitation shock and social-conscience schlock in equal measure.",2.5/4
12998,Set It Up,"Set It Up is cute, sweet, funny and yes predictable but it does what it sets out to do and that is to entertain - which it executes very well.",3/5
12999,The Set-Up,"This is one of the top boxing films ever made, along with Raging Bull and Body and Soul.",A-
13000,Seve the Movie,"This is primarily for fans, but it's engaging enough.",3/5
13001,Seven Chances,Keaton at his stonefaced best,5/5
13002,Seven Beauties (Pasqualino Settebellezze),"The film is a bleakly funny, beautifully made and deeply disturbing work.",5/5
13003,Seven Brides for Seven Brothers,"Accompanying the exhilarating dancing is a fine set of songs, sung with panache, that are memorable for days afterwards.",5/5
13004,Seven Days in May,"...everything a good, taut, riveting conspiracy movie should be.",9/10
13005,Seven Days In Utopia,A squishy Hallmark Channel-level melodrama that rarely bothers to mask its propagandistic intentions.,1.5/5
13006,Seven Faces of Dr. Lao,"Mildly diverting, but no classic",3/5
13007,Seven Girlfriends,"Seven Girlfriends is an oh-so-slight but surprisingly entertaining little movie, buoyed by the seemingly effortless charm of Daly.",2.5/4
13008,Seven Men From Now,A terrific Western especially for those who take their oaters seriously.,A
13009,Seven Pounds,"Director Gabriele Muccino seems to think he's in Ingmar Bergman territory, but he's actually made the longest, most dour episode of My Name is Earl imaginable.",2/5
13010,Seven Psychopaths,"There are scenes of complete brilliance, Walken is better than he's been in years, cute plot loops and grace notes.",4/5
13011,Seven Samurai (Shichinin no Samurai),This movie is so successful because of its flawless direction and very balanced combination of powerful human drama and exciting action.,9/10
13012,Seven Stages to Achieve Eternal Bliss,"It's The Loved One for millennials, a film that forces us to laugh at something we'd rather not even acknowledge. Fortunately, the journey is well worth the price of admission.",4.5/5
13013,Chat gim (The Seven Swords),"Your enjoyment will be limited by your capacity to watch people try to carve each other up. Some of the plot is a little familiar and borrowed from better films including THE GUNS OF NAVARONE. Still, there is some nearly majestic photography.",6/10
13014,The Seven Year Itch,Miss Monroe clearly plays the title role.,2.5/5
13015,Seventeen (Diecisiete),A dog named Oveja... adds that endearing something that is never missing from [director Daniel Sánchez Arévalo's] films. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
13016,The Seventh Seal (Det Sjunde inseglet),"This is an uncompromising film, regarding good and evil with the same simplicity and faith as its hero.",4/4
13017,The Seventh Sign,"[Moore] provides a strong center to the film, but the rest of it, alas, is all over the map.",2/4
13018,Seventh Son,"Seventh Son is a fantastical adventure we've seen time and time again, filled with animated monsters, vapid characters and a female villain that barely rises above being a crazy ex-girlfriend.",5/10
13019,The Seventh Victim,There was also an eerie shower scene that predates Psycho's.,B+
13020,The 7th Voyage of Sinbad,"A grand, glorious outing, with effects-maestro Ray Harryhausen in terrific form.",4/5
13021,Severance,It is being billed as 'Deliverance meets The Office' -- a tellingly misleading description.,2/5
13022,Severe Clear,The battles we see resemble less Coppola's clear-eyed surrealism and more the incoherence-skirting camera jostles of contemporary action directing.,2.5/4
13023,Severed Ways: The Norse Discovery of America,"If all Vikings acted like the two principals in this glacial-paced film, Valhalla must be an empty, desolate place.",C
13024,Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll,"Anchored by a ripping central performance from Serkis, this biopic about notorious musician Ian Dury is too stylish for its own good. Director Whitecross shows ambition and audacity, but his riotous visual style is distracting.",3/5
13025,Sex Addict,Director [Frank Henenlotter] holds fast to his old-school style of goofy thrills and analog FX.,3.5/5
13026,Sex and Breakfast,"Despite an attractive cast and a few nice moments, Sex and Breakfast is just not that exciting.",2/5
13027,Sex and Death 101,"Unapologetically sexy, oddly unpredictable and ultimately kinda (yes) sweet, Sex and Death 101 is just a solid little comedy.",4/5
13028,Sex and Lucia,An intoxicating experience.,4/5
13029,Sex and the City,"Yes, it's good to see the Fab Four together again--you just wish they were in a funnier and wittier film than this indulgent and essentially middlebrow saga that feels like six TV episodes glued together, with a running time of two and a half hours!",C
13030,Sex and the City 2,"Michael Patrick King's fascist, superficial assessment of the Sex and the City girls' intelligence insults them as the women we came to know them as on television, and no doubt has Susan Sontag turning in her grave.",1.5/4
13031,Sex and the Single Girl,"Spain never looked lovelier, but the banal romances of the lightweight principals in this retooled vehicle make the trip wholly unnecessary.",2/5
13032,"Sex, Death And Bowling",Should be quietly euthanised.,1/5
13033,Sex Drive,"Another attempt at being the latest hip,raunchy comedy. And... it rises far above the other impersonators and rip-offs. This movie surprised me in every way.",3.5/4
13034,"Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll",Memorable.,4/5
13035,Sex Is Comedy,"The real revelation in this endlessly engaging feature is the ever-present Parillaud, who dominates the picture like her character dominates the set.",3.5/5
13036,"Sex, Lies, and Videotape","Lean, economical, relatively unpretentious (or at least pretentiously unpretentious), and purposefully small-scale.",3/4
13037,"Sex, Politics & Cocktails",Hernandez seems not to realize that a movie is supposed to sum to something.,1.5/5
13038,Sex Positive,A well-documented look back at this history and these people that most audiences will see when it once it reaches PBS...which it will.,2/5
13039,Sex Tape,Intermittently funny but not without a share of forced comedy.,B
13040,Sextette,"Astonishingly, mesmerizingly bad.",2/5
13041,Sextuplets,The laughless mess of Sextuplets proves that Marlon Wayans still has a big obstacle in the way of his comedic greatness -- himself.,1/4
13042,Sexy Beast,Ray Winstone does a fine job as the troubled Gal.,B-
13043,Seymour: An Introduction,"A forgotten genius, Bernstein also proves an unsung raconteur.",3.5/4
13044,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"I stared at the screen wondering how anyone thought this could possibly have found an audience, even in the degraded '70s.",1/5
13045,Sgt. Bilko,"The movie is saturated with stagnant, one-note performances from stagnant, one-note actors.",2/4
13046,Sgt. Stubby: An American Hero,"In this centenary year of the end of World War I, this story of a real-life dog who served in the trenches is a gentle, engaging way to introduce kids to an essential piece of history.",3.5/5
13047,Sgt. Will Gardner,The takeaway message from Sgt. Will Gardner is that American veterans deserve better.,3/5
13048,Shackleton,"Disappointing, especially in comparison with the documentaries on Shakleton.",1/5
13049,Shade,"In the game of con-poker, a pair of card mechanics beats a full house of gangsters every time.",3.5/5
13050,Shadow,It's like Deliverance turns into Hostel halfway through -- only not nearly as good as either of those films.,2.5/5
13051,Shadow,"Those first two thirds aren't just sluggish--they lack, for Yimou, soul.",2/4
13052,Shadow Company,"A fascinating documentary, shining some needed light on the individuals who are called upon more and more to take fill in the gaps left by a diminished standing military.",5/5
13053,Shadow Conspiracy,"Some political junkies have an inordinate yen for movies that hop-skip around familiar Washington, D.C., locales and inside the bowels of a sinister White House. Members of this club may get some ephemeral amusement out of Shadow Conspiracy.",2.5/4
13054,Shadow Dancer,"Deliberately paced, but fascinating. Owen and Riseborough are superb.",8/10
13055,Shadow: Dead Riot,Director Derek Wan's Z-grade aesthetic is so sad and unpretentious its almost endearing.,1.5/4
13056,Shadow of the Thin Man,"This entry has a thinner story line, fewer colorful characters, and even fewer witty lines than the first three films in the series.",6/10
13057,Shadow of the Vampire,The opening credits sequence is so long and puzzling -- it's not obvious what we're supposed to be looking at -- that it sets a bad tone for the rest of the picture.,2.5/4
13058,Shadowboxer,...never quite becomes anything more than a mildly diverting thriller...,2.5/4
13059,Shadowlands,There are so many things special about this movie it is hard to know where to begin...,3.5/4
13060,Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors (Tini zabutykh predkiv),"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors is one of those rare films that look totally fresh and uncorrupted -- as if the director hadn't pilfered a thing from other film makers but had simply discovered the camera, and how best to use it, by himself.",4/4
13061,Shadows and Fog,"Leaves you hanging at the end, but it's fun putting your head in the noose.",3/5
13062,Shadows & Lies,"Anania seems to have directed his actors to contemplate and reflect on every thing they say, before and after they say it, so they're up there doing all this damned acting, and we're checking our watches.",1.5/5
13063,Shadows in the Sun,"If you've got a tired story, hide it under some gorgeous scenery by setting the film in an exotic locale",2.5/5
13064,Shadrach,"Shadrach is another one of those well-meaning films, like Amistad, in which slaves are the supporting characters in their own stories.",2/4
13065,Shaft,"The best thing the film does, besides nail a nice share of its jokes, is make a genuine story of Shaft learning to care about the example he sets for his son.",2.5/5
13066,Shaft in Africa,"Slow action film with Roundtree misplaced, overdone, overshown.",3/5
13067,Shaft's Big Score!,"Good sequel finds Shaft at it again. The original is better, and so is Shaft in Africa.",3/5
13068,The Shaggy D.A.,"There are also the usual scenes in which cars climb telephone poles, characters do cartwheels in midair, dogs drive ice cream wagons and Keenan Wynn blusters.",2.5/4
13069,The Shaggy Dog,"PETA members may take to The Shaggy Dog. Everyone else over the age of 10, however, will likely prefer a night of sniffing butts to this latest Tim Allen stinker.",1.5/4
13070,Shahid,Mr. Mehta has done something difficult. He has made a film of conviction that's neither plodding nor preachy.,3.5/5
13071,Shakes the Clown,Shakes the Clown is sick but whether it's a joke is a matter of taste. And this film is about as tasteless as they come.,0/4
13072,Shakespeare Behind Bars,"In Shakespeare Behind Bars, the most restricted people in society find freedom in performance and release in words.",3.5/5
13073,Shakespeare High,Shakespeare High follows promising young actors doing their damnedest to make old Bill Shakespeare their own.,3/4
13074,Shakespeare in Love,"At last, a juicy, funny, romantic comedy -- aimed at adults!",10/10
13075,Shakespeare Wallah,"more intimate and nuanced work than the team's subsequent high-profile period films, like The Remains of the Day.",3/5
13076,Shall We Dance,This G-rated version of Unfaithful suggests middle-aged men and women can have their cake as long as they just rub up against it but don't eat it.,1.5/4
13077,Un Baiser s'il vous plaît (Shall We Kiss?),...a romantic comedy that doesn't always go where one expects as the repercussion of a kiss is given weighty exploration.,B
13078,Shallow Ground,"Sure, this is filmed like a standard B-movie thriller, but the plot keeps us guessing ... and it's creepy and unsettling enough to give us nightmares.",3.5/5
13079,Shallow Hal,The end result isn't so much a blind taste test for the male pig than it is a subversive jab at the fragile male ego and the moral sightline.,3.5/4
13080,Skammen (Shame),"Shame moves in deep waters: It shows, in the bleakest and most uncompromising terms, that the worst that war has to offer is the wounds it inflicts on the human mind.",5/5
13081,Shame,"This is fluid, rigorous, serious cinema; the best kind of adult movie.",4/5
13082,Shampoo,"Even though Shampoo didn't blow me away, at least it was more ambitious than anything playing today.",3/4
13083,Shane,"There are intriguing mysteries in Shane, puzzles and challenges, not least in the title character and the way he is played by Alan Ladd.",4/4
13084,Shanghai,"The technical achievements of the picture are numerous, making Shanghai painless to watch. It's maintaining interest in the eroding mystery and its passive players that's a significant challenge.",C
13085,Shanghai Calling,"Throughout there are jokes that feel like in-jokes, about Chinese customs and business practices, but viewers will catch on, just as a visitor might, and start to get the feel of things.",3/4

13088,Shanghai Surprise,Striking visuals and some good George Harrison songs can't save it.,2/5
13089,Shanghai Triad (Yao a yao yao dao waipo qiao),"Shanghai Triad plays like a movie in which some scenes are missing, and others have been stretched out to make up the difference.",2/4
13090,Shank,"With its jarring slang, reckless narrative and offbeat imagery, it's as close to being A Clockwork Orange for the Broken Britain generation as we have. It's up to you to decide whether that's a good thing or not.",2/4
13091,Shaolin,A thoroughly satisfying period action flick with heart and soul; a wholesome step on the path to cinematic enlightenment.,4/5
13092,Shaolin Soccer,"Recaptures the essence of delirious, fantastic action that made Hong Kong the capital of cool through the late 1980s and early 1990s.",B+
13093,Shark Attack 3: Megalodon,"Sure this one may be ""so bad it's good"" but there's something about the flick's outright plagiarism that prevents me from offering it even a backhand compliment",1.5/5
13094,Shark Night 3D,"Ya see, Shark Night 3D is less a horror film-the suspense barely comes from the sharks-and more a made-for-TV drama about Sara's old friends terrorizing her new ones.",C
13095,Shark Tale,A star-studded spectacle that confuses shallow of-the-moment jokes for human emotion.,1/4
13096,Sharknado,"Every so often, something comes along that puts a skip in your step, makes your heart flutter, and sets your imagination ablaze with possibility.... If you're really lucky... it'll be a swirling mass of bloodthirsty sharks.",A
13097,Sharknado 2: The Second One,"Usually, follow-ups to goofy films like the first Sharknado suffer because the makers are too conscious of the original. In this case, though, they just don't seem to give a shark.",1/5
13098,Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!,"Now that we know what to expect from this franchise Sharknado 3 isn't as fun as the original, but still worth one more trip on the crazy train. I desperately want to spoil the amazing, ridiculous ending,",B
13099,Sharknado 5: Global Swarming,"Somehow, Sharknado 5: Global Swarming pulls the franchise back from the brink and returns it to what it's supposed to be: fun to watch.",A
13100,Sharknado: The 4th Awakens,"What can you say about a film in which Gary Busey -- yes, that Gary Busey -- turns in the best performance?This franchise finally jumps the sharknado.",C-
13101,Sharktopus,The cinematic equivalent of eating junk food: It's not particularly good - or good for you - but it's enjoyable and an indulgence in which I partake from time to time.,3.5/5
13102,Sharkwater,Rob Stewart's labour of love goes beyond mere obsession with our 'most amazing and mysterious animal.',4/5
13103,Sharky's Machine,"Sharky's Machine contains all of the ingredients of a tough, violent, cynical big-city cop movie, but what makes it intriguing is the way the Burt Reynolds character plays against those conventions.",3/4
13104,Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure,"Though ""Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure"" doesn't have the same verve or originality of the ""HSM"" movies, it's still solid-pink entertainment that should delight the target audience.",6/10
13105,Shattered Glass,The events unfold with a riveting dread inevitability.,A-
13106,Shaun of the Dead,Idiosyncratic and strangely sweet.,4/5
13107,Shaun the Sheep Movie,The wonder of stop-motion is the mountain of effort required to achieve even the smallest movement. The charm of Shaun the Sheep is that you don't notice it for a moment.,4/5
13108,The Shawshank Redemption,"With his gift for rapt pauses, for caressing just the right syllable, Freeman can make a speech like that sound like one of the philosophical nuggets of the ages.",B-
13109,Shazam!,"Shazam is a delight! Vibrant, tons of heart and a great fun-loving vibe. The family element is a big charmer and so is watching Zachary Levi explore his new powers. Also, if you didn't already know this thanks to IT, Jack Dylan Grazer is sensational.",9/10
13110,She Dies Tomorrow,"Amy Seimetz plays by her own rules as if [She Dies Tomorrow] will be the last film she'll ever make (it won't be, no shot).",4/5
13111,She Done Him Wrong,All the Codes in the world couldn't keep Mae West from being her typical seductive and sexy self.,4/5
13112,She Gets What She Wants,The script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy.,2.5/5
13113,She Hate Me,"Most contracts are negotiated with John Hancocks, but in She Hate Me, deals are sealed with hot lesbian action.",1.5/4
13114,She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,The best of John Ford's trilogy about the 7th Cavalry...,B+
13115,She-Devil,"Barr demonstrates that there is a core of reality inside her TV persona, a core of identifiable human feelings like jealousy and pride, and they provide a sound foundation for her comic acting.",3/4
13116,Sheena,A cheesy classic. Warrior queen Roberts = girl power!,3/5
13117,Sheitan,wrong on so many levels that the mind boggles,2/5
13118,Shelley,"The difference between Shelley's first and second halves is stark in comparison, but thankfully it only gets better as the seconds pass.",7/10
13119,The Sheltering Sky,It is no doubt quite difficult to portray self-indulgence without the work itself taking on an air of arrogance; and certainly The Sheltering Sky fails on that level.,1.5/4
13120,Shenandoah,"Set in a Virginia farm during the Civil War, this popular family film offers all-American star Jimmy Stewart a classic role, a widower with six sons who initially refuses to takes sides or get involved in the conflict--only to learn otherwise.",B
13121,Shepard & Dark,"It's actually a fascinating journey, unfolding - just like real life - in ways that are honest and unexpected and not always pleasant.",3.5/4
13122,Shepherds and Butchers,"Shepherds and Butchers doesn't know which it is: the twisty legal drama that's going to herd us through the issue or the ferocious expose, laying out the quotidian grimness of systemic death.",2/5
13123,Sherlock Jr.,"Sherlock Jr. is Keaton's signature statement, and mind-warping flight of fancy on the dreamlike nature of films and the fluid nature of our ontological existence.",91/100
13124,Sherlock Gnomes,Pretty anemic.,D+
13125,Sherlock Holmes,"Brisk and brainy reworking of the legendary detective's mythos makes the delightful Robert Downey Jr. into a rumpled, complicated and alternately swashbuckling and pratfalling Holmes for our time.",5/5
13126,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows,"... I prefer this one because I think the villain works better, and I think they make some great choices towards the end of the film.",B
13127,Sherlock Holmes and the Woman in Green,engaging in the way it predates both the serial killer narrative ... and the mind-control paranoia that infused Cold War films,3/4
13128,Sherlock Holmes - Dressed to Kill,This is another enjoyable well-paced and acted mystery thriller in the series with the usual pleasant banter between Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.,B
13129,Terror by Night,Penultimate Rathbone Holmes has its moments.,3/5
13130,Sherpa,"The documentary maker Jennifer Peedom went to explore the Sherpas' world and village life -- and their exploitation, which means they may be paid $5,000 for a summer's work, while visitors pay $75,000 for a single death-defying trip.",4/5
13131,Sherrybaby,The compassion of Collyer's attitude toward her wayward and ultimately victimized protagonist slowly builds into a powerful statement on the possibilities of redemption for even the most lost.,3/5
13132,She's All That,The rest is just breezy propaganda for American high school fascism.,2/5
13133,She's Allergic to Cats,It's funky enough to confound but underdeveloped as larger messages fail to resonate beyond fetish-and-fur montages doused in hyperallergic sadness.,2/5
13134,She's Funny That Way,"Apart from reminding us of his well-documented affection for Ernst Lubitsch and the Hollywood comedies of the 1940s, [Bogdanovich] doesn't have anything to tell us - even after all this time away from the big screen.",2/5
13135,She's Gotta Have It,"Spike Lee's first was good for what it was, a low budget student effort, but as a stand alone film it's lacking in many areas.",2/5
13136,She's Having a Baby,She's Having a Baby begins with the simplest and most moving of stories and interrupts it with an amazing assortment of gimmicks.,2/4
13137,She's Just a Shadow,"Whether or not one is seduced by the sensual appeal of it all, it's impossible to deny that this is a cinematic masterpiece.",5/5
13138,She's Missing,"She's Missing loses some emotional moments to disjointed cuts and plot points, but its redolent, tangible sense of place makes it a worthwhile watch.",3/5
13139,She's Out of Control,"She's Out of Control is predictable, silly and contrived, all of which could be forgiven if it were funny enough. It's not.",1.5/4
13140,She's Out of My League,"There's an interesting, funny, quietly devastating film to be made from the core idea here -- that of an average guy so convinced of his unworthiness that he subconsciously sabotages a golden romantic opportunity -- but this overly broad exercise in set-p",1.5/5
13141,She's So Lovely,"What [Nick Cassavetes] understands is that if you want to see true weirdness, you don't look along skid row, where the motives are pretty easy to understand, but out in suburbia, where those green lawns can surround human time bombs.",3/4
13142,She's the Man,"Bynes does such a good job as a boy that it comes across as funny and entertaining, even if you have graduated from high school.",7/10
13143,She's the One,"With a budget about 120 times greater than McMullen, Burns has made She's the One, a film just as unlikely to offend...and, unfortunately, equally unlikely to entertain.",5/10
13144,She-Wolf of London (The Curse of the Allenbys),Lassie's mom might be a werewolf in this shaggy lyncanthrope story,1/5
13145,Shifty,"Creevy eschews the woozy, arthouse ambience of Duane Hopkins' Better Things - another portrait of a drug-decimated community - for naturalistic dialogue and performances within carefully framed and composed shots; properly cinematic, grown-up direction.",3.5/5
13146,Shiloh 2: Shiloh Season,A carbon-copy of most other 'dog & boy' movies.,2/4
13147,Shimmer Lake,"In spite of myself, I kinda like Shimmer Lake.",6/10
13148,Shine,"His life story is not exactly as it is shown here, but close enough, I gather, for us to marvel at the way the human spirit can try to heal itself.",4/4
13149,Shine a Light,"A celebration of the Stones and star Mick Jagger, Scorsese's Shine a Light is an exuberant concert film that captures vividly the charisma and energy of the vet band but shouldn't be considered a docu as there's little footage or interviews--by design.",B+
13150,A Shine of Rainbows,A Shine of Rainbows is a sweet tale about a little boy and the mother who teaches him to appreciate every nook and cranny of everyday life.,3/5
13151,The Shining,"Strays from the source material, but still a creepy classic.",9/10
13152,Shining Through,Here is a film in which scene after scene is so implausible that the movie kept pushing me outside and making me ask how the key scenes could possibly be taken seriously.,2/4
13153,San suk si gin (The Shinjuku Incident),"Try as he might, strut as he does toward climactic showdowns with ruthless adversaries, [Chan's] character remains an incongruous muddle. Same goes for the movie.",2/4
13154,Ship of Fools,"Werner and Signoret were wonderful, and deserved their nominations.",3.5/5
13155,The Shipping News,"There just isn't much happening here, other than some foreshadowing as subtle as a dump truck in a minefield.",6/10
13156,Shiri,Innocuous enough to make even Jean-Claude Van Damme look good.,1/4
13157,Shirin In Love,"A pallid romantic comedy possessed of neither imagination nor heart, it stumbles, like its star, from one familiar setpiece to another with a kind of dutiful, joyless resignation.",2/5
13158,Shirkers,"Shirkers has the handmade delicacy of a scrapbook come to life, blending ample footage from the original production with candid modern-day interviews and photography.",B+
13159,Shirley,The things Elisabeth Moss does in Shirley are quietly astonishing.,A-
13160,Shirley Valentine,There were moments during the movie when I cringed at the manipulative dialogue as the heroine recited warmed-over philosophy and inane one-liners when she should have been allowed to speak for herself.,1/4
13161,Shock and Awe,A schmaltzy look at the workings of a syndicate determined to expose the U.S. mistake in Iraq while one of its subsidiaries refuses to print it.,C+

13163,The Shock Doctrine,"A stunning, exquisitely photographed and narrated diatribe against the excesses of capitalism.",A-
13164,Shock to the System: A Donald Strachey Mystery,"Pity there was no room for Phyllis Diller or Carol Channing here, because then the film might have had a leg up on Scooby-Doo and the Creepy Castle.",2/4
13165,Shock Wave,This is a workman-like and heavy-handed effort that is unlikely to knock anyone's socks off.,2.5/5
13166,Shocker,Um dos piores filmes da carreira de Wes Craven - e perceba que estamos falando do responsvel pelo terrvel Um Vampiro no Brooklyn...,1/5
13167,Shockproof,"While Shockproof will inspire more groans than gasps, it's essential viewing for fans of Mr. Fuller and Mr. Sirk.",3/5

13169,Shoeshine (Sciuscià),Shoeshine's tragedy evolves from the overall environment and system as much as it does from the individual choices the boys make.,A
13170,Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness,Poignant first-rate documentary on the prolific Yiddish literary figure who went by the pen name of Sholem Aleichem.,A-
13171,Shoot 'Em Up,"Fast-paced, ultra-violent, spectacular and preposterous, Shoot 'Em Up may be the most pleasurable, kinetic, and trashy actioner, a truly cult midnight flick, since Rodriguez's El Mariachi and Desperado.",B
13172,Shoot the Moon,"Despite its flaws, despite its gaps, despite two key scenes that are dreadfully wrong, Shoot the Moon contains a raw emotional power of the sort we rarely see in domestic dramas.",3.5/4
13173,Shoot the Piano Player (Tirez sur le pianiste),A marvelously funny movie about sadness.,5/5
13174,Shoot to Marry,This documentary is extremely intimate. Three quarters of this film were uncomfortable to watch... You are kind grossed out by what's happening but not enough to turn it off because you need to see how it is going to end.,8.5/10
13175,Shooter,"This old-fashioned revenge actioner suffers from a prepsoterous plot and lack of logic and credibility, a peculiar combo of an inner-directed hero that would make John Wayne proud and a cynical tone of conspiracy thrillers like Three Days of the Condor.",C
13176,Shooting Heroin,A noble idea marred by melodramatics.,2.5/5

13232,Silent Fall,It's the kind of picture that results when a film maker loses sight of the fact that a portion of his audience might actually think while watching a movie.,1.5/4
13233,Silent Hill,it's the ferocious production design and unrelenting atmosphere that fully immerses us in Gans' horrifically breathtaking Silent Hill.,4.5/5
13234,Silent Hill: Revelation,"Revelation has no personality to speak of, with a reduced budget and limited directorial vision turning the potential for an atmospheric terror picture into a television melodrama with occasional bursts of macabre happenings.",D

13253,Simpatico,"Ultimately the film, like the story, is enigmatic and messy and circles in on itself until there is nowhere to go.",C-
13254,Simple Men,"The problem with postmodern movies like Simple Men is that they seem to consider us fools for watching them and, on the basis of the evidence on the screen, it's hard to disagree.",2/4

13263,Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger,"Anything with Ray Harryhausen, and I'm there!",4/5
13264,Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas,"Sinbad is harmlessly inoffensive enough to be enjoyed by the kind of pre-teen kids who love a good swashbuckling adventure full of all those cartoon cliches, but anyone hoping for more will have to set sail on another adventure.",2.5/5

13268,Sing Your Song,"Like its subject, Sing Your Song is a passionate film bursting with energy, music and often fury.",4/5
13269,Singin' in the Rain,Singin' in the Rain isn't just one of the classics of Old Hollywood. It is also one very fine example of a genre that is almost banished from the big studios of today -- musicals.,9/10
13270,The Singing Detective,A visual delight and an acting tour-de-force.,3.5/5
13271,Single White Female,"All of this escalates in its level of ridiculousness until there are unintentional laughs attending a new use for stiletto heels and a chase through Fonda's tenement building, which never seems to have any tenants in sight.",1.5/4
13272,Sinister 2,The whole thing has a rather goofy feel to it.,1.5/4
13273,Sinister,'Sinister' is so incredibly stupid. But it IS SCARY. The best way to describe it is '8MM' meets 'Paranormal Activity.',5/10

13277,SiREN,"More gruesome than horrific, but the cast and effects let this indie horror pic punch above its weight class.",2/4
13278,Sister Act,The trailer has high energy and whammo punchlines. The movie is sort of low-key and contemplative and a little too thoughtful.,2.5/4

13295,Skate Kitchen,Skate Kitchen turns its subjects into a fascinating microcosm of American youth.,B+
13296,Skateland,"Burns, a former journalist and screenwriter, and cameraman Peter Simonite make great use of the film's East Texas setting. Skateland may be produced with limited resources, but Burns captures the look and spirit of the times with perfect detail.",4/5

13370,Slutty Summer,Decently acted and briskly directed -- but thoroughly predictable and sometimes achingly sincere.,2/4
13371,Small Apartments,A toxically quirky black comedy starring a morbidly obese albino who dreams of traveling to Switzerland.,1/4
13372,"Small, Beautifully Moving Parts","Gentler and less aesthetically assaultive than 0s & 1s and Catfish, but it's not necessarily any subtler or more enlightening.",1.5/4

13374,Small Soldiers,...wildly entertaining...,3/4

13376,Small Time Crooks,A wonderful alternative to the season's bloated blockbusters.,3/4
13377,Small Town Crime,The movie runs at a pace that keeps you engaged from scene-to-scene and the twists and turns of the plot take you on an unexpected trip that will have you laughing one moment and cringing with fear the next.,5/5
13378,Small Town Gay Bar,"Inherently moving and excruciatingly truthful, Malcolm Ingram's small town gay bar is the story of real people in a real place, documenting their fight to create a family of love and acceptance in a world that has offered them none.",4.5/5

13381,Smash His Camera,"As king of the paparazzi, Ron Galella has been slugged by Marlon Brando, sued by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and slurred by other photographers. Now, filmmaker Leon Gast turns his camera on Galella, and the result is fascinating and full of surprises.",4/5
13382,Smash Palace,"By the end of the film, the man is behaving irrationally, but here's the frightening thing: Because we've followed him every step of the way, we have to admit he's behaving as we ourselves might, in the same circumstances.",4/4

13384,Smiles of a Summer Night,Bergman was a master to have crafted all of this material together so that it was entertaining.,3/5
13385,Smiley,The chances of seeing a bunch of people dressed as Smiley this October 31st is giving too much credit to a project that will be forgotten before it has any chance of becoming more than a minor pop-cultural footnote.,1.5/4
13386,Smiley Face,"A decent diversion for those who are into comedies that are different than your standard fare. The visuals are great, the comedy is new and refreshing.",3.5/5
13387,Smithereens,"Susan Seidelman's feature debut, the first American indie to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival, put New York's East Village sensibility onscreen by examining issues of identity, desire and self-fulfillment from a distinctly female perspective.",B

13389,Smokey and the Bandit,The true mark of a good action flick is that it knows when to play dumb and when not to.,84/100
13390,Smokey and the Bandit II,Sadly cashes in on the original.,3/5
13391,Smokin' Aces,"Full respect to Carnahan for making the tired crime genre feel fresh, but it would have been more fun without a last-minute attempt to make it mean something.",3/5
13392,Smokin' Aces 2: Assassin's Ball,"Co-hatched and executive produced by Carnahan himself, the filmmaker should hang his head in shame over this cut-rate, slapdash cash-in. It's a ghastly, embarrassing motion picture.",F

13395,Snabba cash (Easy Money),Easy Money builds to an absolutely electrifying finale that's as exciting and thrilling as anything within the genre (and it's certainly difficult not to wish that the rest of the proceedings had been even remotely as jaw-droppingly exciting).,3.5/4
13396,Snake & Mongoo$e,A flawed but essential film for its target audience.,2.5/4
13397,Snake Eyes,"After the premise settles in the dust just as it should, the movie crumbles into one big mess where the characters spurt out some incredibly dumb dialogue and act like they are in some sort of Spice Girls music video.",2/4
13398,The Snake Pit,"As one of Hollywood's first ""serious"" chronicles of life in an asylum, the film is uneven, containing some intelligent observations but also lurid sequences and simplistic psychological explanations.",B+

13400,The Snapper,"The Snapper sees its characters with warmth and acceptance, and earns its laughs by being wise about human nature.",3.5/4
13401,Snapshots,"Performances all around are strong, with Piper Laurie's Rose taking the lead and directing us through the story's narrative. We are invited to soak in the retro atmosphere as the story unfolds at a leisurely pace.",8/10

13403,Snatched,"Snatched is a movie in the flimsiest sense; in terms of craftsmanship, the best that can be said is that it clears the very low bar set by the typo in the expository opening crawl.",C+
13404,Snatchers,"This is a fun, crazy, sci-fi-horror-gore-comedy that delivers a healthy little message and still manages to be a silly bit of fun. I really can't wait to see what Stephen Cedars, Benji Kleiman, & Scott Yacyshyn do next.",8/10
13405,Sneakers,"A delirious guilty pleasure, Sneakers is about as probable as me parting the Red Sea -- and just as fun.",4.5/5

13423,So Much So Fast,"Completely, perfectly balanced in its approach.",A
13424,So Undercover,That the movie is slated for a straight-to-DVD release in the US next year is probably indicative of its cinematic potential. It all feels a little bit sitcommy.,2/5
13425,Soaked In Bleach,"After a while, Statler's hodgepodge approach loses its novelty, and the documentary starts to seem like an overlong, overly strident segment of a true-crime cable TV infotainment series.",2/5

13427,S.O.B.,If only it were half as clever as it thinks it is.,3/5
13428,Sobibor,There is an evident disconnect between the story the film is trying to tell and how they want it to reach mass audiences. [Full Review in Spanish],1/5
13429,Social Animals,"A ""People's Republic of Austin"" rom-com that's absurd on many levels, and not funny on any of them.",1.5/4
13430,Social Animals,A well-crafted character study about three disparate people who have nothing in common except for the possession of an Instagram account.,B+
13431,Society,"Dreary suburban drama with a goopy horror finale, Society seems to be about a whole lot of ideas - when in truth it presents one or two pedestrian concepts and then repeats them ad nauseum.",2/5
13432,Socrates,"Thankfully, filmmaker Moratto remains intensely personal about these darkly political themes, keeping cameras tight on Socrates' face to draw out his inner feelings.",4/5
13433,La Peau douce (The Soft Skin),Truffaut's fourth feature... is assembled with the kind of wit and impeccable style that are in such shortage today.,B+
13434,Softness of Bodies,"A portrait of a narcissistic poet, Softness of Bodies will most likely appeal to the viewer who can identify with the 'struggling artist' existence.",3/5
13435,Solace,Solace is mildly entertaining in bursts ... but clichs thwart it for the most part and the final twist can be seen coming from a mile off.,2/5
13436,Solarbabies,"Since the movie so clearly required great dedication, especially in its visual effects and the use of its desert locations, I can only wonder why they didn't spend equal effort on finding an original story to tell.",2/4
13437,Solaris,"Stephen Soderbergh takes Full Frontal into the stratosphere with Solaris, a prolonged grief counseling session with a minimalist sci-fi backdrop.",1.5/4
13438,Soldier Blue,The film is too mixed up to qualify as a serious allegory about anything.,1.5/4
13439,Soldiers of Fortune,"While the conclusion doesn't inspire much enthusiasm, Soldiers of Fortune carries a lot further than most of its ilk, providing a small dose of entertainment in a genre that typically elicits eye-rolls and yawns.",B-

13444,Solitude,"When the [ending] surprises finally come, the letdown in the audience is palpable, as the twists are small and relatively inconsequential.",2/4
13445,Sollers Point,"The filmmaker demonstrates a rising talent to build characters who, in just a couple of appearances, are filled with life. [Full review in Spanish]",80/100
13446,Solo,Soloflex might be a better title.,D
13447,Solo: A Star Wars Story,"Solo is a fun ride for sure, but it feels too commercial. It is the least epic installment of the Star Wars franchise.",3/5
13448,Solo Con Tu Pareja,"The film is like a champagne bottle's ricocheting cork: an explosion of poppy camera maneuvers, literary allusions, chatty reiterations, raunchy sex, and spastic flights of fantasy rich in cultural flavor.",2.5/4
13449,The Soloist,"It's all a bit shapeless, yet made with sincerity and taste, and the two actors seize your sympathy.",B
13450,Solomon and Sheba,Tyrone Power morreu durante as filmagens deste trabalho que tambm marcou a despedida do veterano cineasta King Vidor. Ambos mereciam uma despedida mais nobre do que uma produo formulaica e medocre como esta.,2/5
13451,Solomon Kane,"Storywise, it leaves a lot to be desired ... has many tonal and pacing problems, mainly because like the source material, it's all handled very seriously.",6/10

13455,Some Girls,...an exercise in irritation that possesses exceedingly little in the way of positive attributes.,1/4
13456,Some Girl(s),Even this lesser LaBute offers a nice twist to his characteristically stinging dissection of man's inhumanity to man--and especially woman.,B
13457,Some Guy Who Kills People,Director Perez's finesse with the flick's dramatically flaired (and gleefully gory) death scenes that proves guts and gore aren't the only ways to keep genre fans entertained.,4/5
13458,Some Kind of Beautiful,"A hodgepodge of horny-old-man clichs writ large, staged as a gleeful affirmation of its male lead's ego and entitlement.",0.5/4

13464,Somebody Up There Likes Me,One of the funnier movies you can shrug off.,2.5/4

13467,Someone to Love,...a strangely compelling piece of work...,2.5/4
13468,Someone to Watch over Me,"Movies like this are on automatic pilot. Unless we are very young, very naive or hopelessly lusting after one of the stars, there is little to interest us aside from interior decorating hints.",2/4
13469,Somers Town,At its best a winning anecdote of adolescent male awkwardness adapting to the big city.,2.5/4
13470,Somersault,This visually haunting coming-of-age tale marks the individual stamp of yet another original Australian female director to watch.,3.5/5
13471,Something,"More a mood piece than a horror tale, ""Something"" is a low-budget movie that commands attention without the need for bells and whistles.",B

13475,Something Like Happiness,In the film's evocation of industrialized squalor you get an emphatic sense of location effecting personal action.,2.5/4
13476,Something New,Something New's title doesn't extend to the film's race-conscious rom-com formula.,2/4

13481,Something's Gotta Give,"But really, seriously, what woman wouldn't want to be Keaton, all sexy, funny, tender, quick, and never more charismatic in her animated access to her own feelings? And what man, of any age, wouldn't want to be with her?",B+
13482,Sometimes a Great Notion (Never Give an Inch),"Newman starts tunneling under the material, coming up with all sorts of things we didn't quite expect, and along the way he proves himself as a director of sympathy and a sort of lyrical restraint.",3/4

13490,Son of Godzilla,Cheesy good Godzilla fun. How could you not like?,3/5

13503,Son of the Pink Panther,Edwards loses sight of what Benigni does best -- full-body physical shtick -- trapping him in long-shot gags that could be anybody.,2.5/5
13504,Sonatine,"It shows how violent gangster movies need not be filled with stupid dialogue, nonstop action and gratuitous gore.",3.5/4
13505,The Song of Bernadette,"Based on the historical novel by Jewish author Franz Werfel, the beloved classic The Song of Bernadette stands head and shoulders over most religiously themed fare from Hollywood’s golden age.",A

13511,The Song Remains The Same,LZ fans will overlook the flaws. Others need not apply.,4/5
13512,Song to Song,"In some ways Song to Song is a more straightforward narrative than the intensely personal Knight of Cups, but just as blindingly beautiful and formally distinctive.",5/5

13517,Soni,"I'm unsure if any version of this script could have lifted the lifeless decision to shoot the film in many, separate tracking long takes, because it is so overwhelmingly distracting that it renders everything going on in the film mute.",D
13518,Sonic the Hedgehog,"Eventually Jim Carrey shows up as the villain, all mustache and ego and wild-eyes and gadgets and insults, and things turn funnier.",1.5/4
13519,The Sons of Katie Elder,Those who favour the big-hearted Americana and rolling landscapes of non-revisionist westerns could do far worse than this movie.,59/100
13520,Sons of Perdition,"What's here is compelling, if occasionally hard to follow.",3/5

13558,Southie,"A very familiar crime story, one that has been often done in recent times.",C
13559,Southland Tales,"Swings from dark comedy to political message film to science fiction, with occasional dips into noir, religion and even a musical number featuring Justin Timberlake.",3.5/5
13560,Southlander: Diary of a Desperate Musician,Pleasantly diverting no-budget comedy with fun cameo appearances.,3/5
13561,Southpaw,"The melodrama is absorbing and well directed, but I have to take points away for indulging so much in jacked up brutality of sustained fight scenes... and behavioral swings on the extremes of sympathetic acceptance.",3.5/5
13562,Southside With You,"A romantic, frustrated, compassionate, quietly moving film.",3.5/4
13563,Soylent Green,Classic science fiction that is well-worth seeing.,3/4
13564,Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back,"Features clunky, outdated CGI, a script so flat it's practically Holland and rubbish character design.",1/5
13565,Space Cowboys,The talent of the four stars makes up for anything that's less than envelope-pushing waggery.,8/10
13566,Space Jam,"This mediocrity disguised as entertainment, this greed promoted as synergy -- this, to paraphrase that seminal media study, Broadcast News, is what the devil looks like. It's Tasmanian, and it's coming to a multiplex near you.",D+

13568,Space Truckers,You read it right: That's Space...Truckers.,4/10
13569,Spaceballs,It's silly and good natured.,76/100
13570,Spaced Invaders,"Maybe I've lost touch with silly, brainless entertainments like this. Let's hope so: One of the purposes of growing up and getting an education is to learn why movies like Spaced Invaders are a waste of time.",1.5/4
13571,Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone,Ages like good cheese,3/5
13572,Spaceman,"Overall the results are amiable, if also slack and talky.",2/4
13573,Spaceship Earth,The story is intriguing and weird but unfortunately told with all the energy of a dry boring lecture,3/10
13574,Spanglish,Spanglish is more adept at balancing humor and drama than just about any movie I have seen this year.,3.75/4
13575,Spanish Lake,"This is a fascinating story ... But as a movie, ""Spanish Lake"" misses the opportunity to include other voices.",2.5/4
13576,The Spanish Prisoner,This is a nifty puzzler for those who like to use their noodle.,B
13577,Spare Parts,Spare Parts stands and delivers on its own intriguing merits.,2.5/5
13578,Spark: A Burning Man Story,"The doc doesn't take the time to examine why Burning Man inspires such a level of fanaticism, overshadowing human interest with a gluttony of B roll.",1.5/4
13579,Spark: A Space Tail,An utterly lifeless and profoundly unoriginal animated effort that is desperately lacking the very thing in its title.,1/4
13580,Sparkle,The mix of comedy and drama doesn't feel so free and easy as Lawless Heart but it has a similarly quaint charm.,3/5
13581,Sparkle,There may or may not be an actual movie hidden among all the showstopping musical numbers in Sparkle. Not that there needs to be.,3/4
13582,Sparks,Sparks shows plenty of cinematic muscle. It deserves a place among the legion of superhero movies.,B
13583,Spartan,Mamet makes movies for people who love hearing themselves talk.,1/4
13584,Spawn,"The story is about... but heck, who cares? The movie itself doesn't care.",1/4
13585,Speak,Ultimately too superficially diffuse - and programmed to reveal a winner - to focus on one kind of human interest story.,2.5/5
13586,Speak The Music: Robert Mann And The Mysteries Of Chamber Music,"Insightful, but strictly for avid fans of classical chamber music.",6.1/10
13587,Special,"With the often uproarious and always poignant comedy Special, co-screenwriters and directors Jeremy Passmore and Hal Haberman have created a moving and pertinent parable for our medicated times.",3.5/5
13588,Special Correspondents,A sitcom riff on Wag the Dog with its satirical edges sanded away.,D+
13589,Una Giornata Particolare (A Special Day),"Cast against type, Mastroianni (Oscar-nominated) and Sophia Loren deliver great performances in Ettore Scola's sensitive drama about a suicidal homosexual and a tired housewife.",B+
13590,Special Effects,"A significant (if ultimately chaotic) entry in the director's canon of ramshackle tributes to the dark, dangerous, voyeuristic allure of the cinema.",B
13591,Special Forces,War is awful. We get it.,2/5
13592,Special ID,[T]he story is a hopeless mess that from the outset seems to be missing key exposition that might help fill in some of its many gaps.,2.5/5
13593,Special Treatment,"The tag line for the advertising campaign is bold: 'A film that dares to tell the truth about women.' I, unfortunately, missed whatever truth that was.",2/5
13594,Species,"A somewhat thoughtful film was not what I was expecting out of Species, and sure enough, by the time the second hour rolls around, the film degenerates into a formulaic search and destroy movie.",2.5/5
13595,Species II,Species II is one sequel that screams...Yuck! It also conjures up...Why? Screenplay be damned. Acting? Throw it out the window.,0/4
13596,Species III,...Species III is often incredibly dull - no small feat given the amount of nudity and violence in the flick.,1.5/4
13597,Spectre,"This isn't the perfect Bond. It's over-long at two and half hours, and there are intermittent longueurs before it finally gets all the afterburners firing for the concluding 45 minutes. But lots of it is great, too.",4/5
13598,Speech & Debate,"All in all, this is a plucky but rather disorganised attempt to explore pressing issues. For a teen-focused film, it's refreshingly lacking in cynicism, but its fate will depend on whether or not its audience shares this quality.",2.5/5
13599,Speed,"The film takes off from formula elements, but it manipulates those elements so skillfully, with such a canny mixture of delirium and restraint, that I walked out of the picture with the rare sensation that every gaudy thrill had been earned.",A
13600,Speed 2 - Cruise Control,Speed 2 finds director De Bont and actor Bullock too content to coast on automatic.,4/10
13601,Speed-Dating,A titillating tribute to the novel notion of strangers with benefits.,2/4
13602,Speed Kills,"Travolta crime thriller has mob violence, cursing.",1/5
13603,Speed of Life,"Though it may not get the mechanics of quantum physics exactly right, SPEED LIFE gets everything else about how the universe works just about perfect.",3
13604,Speed Racer,"Like other Wachowski works, this hybrid of f/x-driven family fare is technically inventive and in moments seductively surreal, but the plot is so slender and naive, sort of excuse for some thrilling races that should please very young non-critical viewers",C
13605,Speed Sisters,"If Vin Diesel is looking to up the ante for the next ""Furious"" entry, he might start by looking at the Speed Sisters.",4/5
13606,Speedway Junky,"A potent mixture of sentiment and grit, and it showcases the talents of its young principals.",4.5/5
13607,Speedy,"While not a masterpiece on the order of 1923's Safety Last! and 1925's The Freshman, Speedy still ranks as grade-A entertainment from the great Harold Lloyd.",3.5/4
13608,Breakaway,"The shakiest scenes in Breakaway, a hockey-meets-Bollywood mash-up about skating Sikh-Canadians, occur on the ice. Take that for what you will. The rest of this nimbly-paced but routinely-plotted sports fable is tolerably more entertaining.",2.5/5
13609,Spenser Confidential,"It's not even clear why the film is called ""Spenser Confidential."" There's nothing hush-hush about it except this: Everyone associated with the film might want to keep that confidential.",1/4
13610,Sphere,"Cool premise and eerie buildup from the first hour, ultimately downshifts into an unsatisfying film that drags long past its bedtime, and turns into a gobbledygook of psychological head games and illusions.",5/10
13611,Spice World,"Ultimately, Spice World's real analogue isn't A Hard Day's Night but the cruddy, engagingly lightweight cash-ins that followed, from Freddie and the Dreamers' Seaside Swingers all the way to The Monkees on TV.",C
13612,Spider Baby,"Simultaneously creepy and hilarious, this is the perfect slice of Grand Guignol for a humid summer's night.",3/5
13613,Spider in the Web,"Sir Ben puts on a clinic in how to play a cunning, canny, cultured and charming old spy in this sturdy, if murky, Israeli espionage thriller.",2.5/4
13614,Spider-Man: Far From Home,"Spider-Man: Far From Home is a bristling extravaganza which lands ten times better than Homecoming. It is hilarious, charming and the twists are brilliantly intriguing.",4/5
13615,Spider-Man: Homecoming,"The characters and scenarios are familiar, but this is a loose, cool, funny remix that makes them feel fresh again. Plus, it's mercifully short on life lessons from Aunt May.",4/5
13616,Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,It's the best stand-alone film to feature the iconic character so far.,3.5/4
13617,Spiderhole,Hole-y crap.,1/5
13618,Spider-Man,"A perfect summer popcorn movie with lots of great effects, enough action, plenty of laughs, lots of romance and a great deal of heart.",4/4
13619,Spider-Man 2,"Like Spider-Man before it, Spider-Man 2 is a superhero flick bursting at the seams with big emotions.",3/4
13620,Spider-Man 3,"What truly is most amazing about Spider-Man 3 (no pun intended) is that all objections are answered and all developments are resolved, even if at times it feels like they will never converge.",4/5
13621,Spiders,"Evoked for me pleasant childhood memories of watching such ""giant monsters on the loose"" B-movies as ""Them!,"" ""Tarantula"" and ""The Giant Spider Invasion."" Excellent special effects.",B-
13622,"Spiders, Part 1: The Golden Lake (Die Spinnen, 1. Teil - Der Goldene See)",Lang made the story exuberant and exotic.,B-
13623,The Spiderwick Chronicles,A classic adventure with its heart and its sense of whimsy in all the right places.,4/5
13624,Spies in Disguise,"Run-of-the-mill modern-day animated fare, but it's also hard to say no to Tom Holland and Will Smith playing off of one another",3/5
13625,Spies Like Us,A struggle,2/5
13626,Spike Island,"Unfortunately, great music can only distract us so much in this disappointing feature from the talented Mat Whitecross.",2/5
13627,Spin Out,"Everyone here, even the big city interlopers, is basically decent and everyone's just out for some sensible, non-aggressive fun. Which would be fine if the end result stood out in any way,",2.5/5
13628,Spine Tingler: The William Castle Story,A long overdue and very entertaining documentary on one of Hollywood's most colorful salesmen.,4/5
13629,Spinning Into Butter,A flawed but needed film about the continuing existence of racism and deep-rooted prejudice exposed on a college campus.,3/5
13630,Spinning Man,The filmmakers don't bring the main characters' contrasting methods of divining truth into total opposition.,2/4
13631,Spinning Plates,"Kind of all over the place, like a mismatched meal. But fascinating.",2.5/4
13632,Spiral,"The anecdotal, multi-narrative approach is useful in personalizing the phenomenon, but the movie still brought me up short.",2.5/4
13633,Spiral Farm,"This isn't a takedown of communes or alternative lifestyles, but a character study of a handful of people who've gravitated toward that kind of living arrangement or were born into it.",8/10
13634,The Spirit of '76,You might get a campish kick from The Spirit of '76...Where else can you find a film that has teen idol David Cassidy sharing time with new wave fave Devo?,3.5/5
13635,The Spirit of St. Louis,"A haunting recollection of one of the thrilling events of our times has been handsomely staged by Mr. Wilder, and for that you should see the film.",2.5/5
13636,Spirit - Stallion of the Cimarron,Everything feels extra-maudlin when set to bloodcurdling anthems from Bryan Adams.,2/4
13637,Spirit Trap,"Fairly standard haunted house stuff, really. But a high energy level and a willingness to go way over the top makes it quite entertaining.",3/5
13638,Spirited Away,"Even the worst Miyazaki picture is a remarkable achievement, and Spirited Away is one of his better films.",4/4
13639,The Spitfire Grill,"It's an unabashedly manipulative, melodramatic tearjerker with plot twists that Horatio Alger would have been embarrassed to use, and the fact that it's so well acted only confuses the issue.",2/4
13640,Splendor in the Grass,Watchable but not great.,3/5
13641,Splintered,Halligan handles the low-budget horror with adroitly but the by-the-numbers plotting takes the edge off the scares.,2/5
13642,Splinters,"[VIDEO] Adam Pesce's absorbing cross-cultural documentary about a small indigenous community in the village of Vanimo, Papua New Guinea provides an intimate view into an island culture revolutionized by one thing, a surfboard.",B+
13643,Split,Split is one further step for Shyamalan on the road to cinematic redemption. We can only hope he continues to work at this level of production.,B
13644,Spoken Word,"Well-enough executed by a capable cast to recommend, especially for heathens unfamiliar with the Biblical tale which ostensibly served as the source of inspiration.",2.5/4
13645,The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie,"smacks some surprisingly sophisticated wit into its take on the usual mass-produced, lifeless piffle that populates Saturday morning cartoons. Spongebob is hip",3/5
13646,Spork,"For all its poignancy, ""Spork"" never loses sight of its goal to be zesty, sharp-witted fun.",4/5
13647,Spotlight,"Where ""Birdman"" magnified Keaton's talent, ""Spotlight"" leans on it.",B
13648,Spread,Is there anything soggier than a cad redeemed?,C
13649,Spree,"Spree feels like an extended episode of Black Mirror. One that begins as a delightful comedy full of gonzo energy that revels in the bloodshed, but stretches out too long. We've received this message before, and ultimately it feels empty.",2/5
13650,Spring,An inventive original and leads to some stunning transformations and suspenseful sequences. Benson and Moorhead know how to manipulate the audience in a fun way. It's okay. You can trust them to take you on a good ride.,8/10
13651,Spring Breakdown,A very bad genre exercise starring some very good comedic actresses who really should change agencies soon.,0/5
13652,Spring Breakers,"[Korine] bounces back like a man possessed, rekitted as some 21st-century Russ Meyer, playing disreputable paterfamilias to a fresh breed of supervixens.",4/5
13653,Spring Forward,A marvelous movie about a friendship that slowly unspools between two unlikely souls.,5/5
13654,"Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter...and Spring","Just as every action in the film has its own reaction, every image evokes the oneness of the film's characters to their natural surroundings.",3/4
13655,Springsteen And I,"Springsteen & I is an emotionally raw, intimate glimpse at hero worship and what it is to be a Bruce fan.",4/5
13656,Springsteen on Broadway,"Not only does ""Springsteen on Broadway"" work on its own as a Netflix special, it gives you all the same feels seeing the show live at the Walter Kerr Theater brought out.",4/4
13657,Springtime in a Small Town (Xiao cheng zhi chun),Tian emphasizes the isolation of these characters by confining color to Liyan's backyard.,2.5/4
13658,Sprinter,Plot threads play out in mostly expected ways. But Saulter elevates the material through the specificity of its Jamaican context.,3/4
13659,Spun,Spun is about as wild a ride as you're likely to see on screen this year.,3/4
13660,Sputnik,"Lacking in killer instinct, Sputnik is a competently put together film which could have benefited more from its deadly concept.",3/5
13661,Spy,"Feig's commitment to the genre, and some truly wonderful set pieces, make ""Spy"" as lovable as its main character.",B
13662,Spy Game,Tony Scott always knows how to put on a good show.,2.5/4
13663,Spy Hard,You won't laugh hard at Spy Hard. And that's not because the jokes aren't funny. Most of them aren't even jokes.,1.5/4
13664,Spy Intervention,"The espionage component never generates the slightest hint of genuine danger, and the romantic element is contrived and obvious.",C-
13665,Spy Kids,One of those rare breedsa live-action family film that relies on intelligence and adventure to tell its story.,2.5/4
13666,Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams,Gizmos are groovy but parents are even more cool.,2.5/4
13667,Spy Kids 3-D - Game Over,Few films exploit the merchandising angle as cynically as SPY KIDS 3-D: GAME OVER.,0/5
13668,Spy Kids: All the Time in the World in 4D,"A passable shake-up, even if its 'Aroma-scope' experiment stinks. Like Ricky Gervais, the Spy Kids franchise could drone on - sorry, go on - forever.",2/5
13669,The Spy Next Door,It's pitched at a pre-teen audience -- the only kind likely to enjoy Levant's cheap misfire.,0.5/4
13670,The Spy Who Loved Me,"It's still not my idea of what James Bond should be, but somehow it works.",3/4
13671,Spymate,"It's a half-baked movie that looks strangely dated (it was actually made in 2003), underfinanced and simplistic next to films with the same theme, like the Spy Kids series.",2/4
13672,Squanto: A Warrior's Tale,"Squanto is the kind of superficial, tidied-up, idealized history that might appeal to younger viewers. No thoughtful person will be able to take it seriously.",1.5/4
13673,Square Grouper: The Godfathers of Ganja,Billy Corben's doc boasts little intoxicating energy or compelling drama.,1.5/4
13674,The Squid and the Whale,"The most impressive debut at Sundance was Noah Baumbach's wickedly, heartbreakingly funny divorce drama, The Squid and the Whale. A time-capsule keeper.",5/5
13675,St. Agatha,"Never frightening, St. Agatha makes a bad mistake in weaving in an extended flashback (which calls out to Antichrist, of all things), so that Mary and the other girls imprisoned at the home never feel truly imprisoned there.",1/4
13676,St. Bernard Syndicate,St. Bernard Syndicate is an adequate film for what it is.,7/10
13677,St. Elmo's Fire,Everything collapses under its own weight.,2/4
13678,St. Ives,St. Ives is an ambitious Charles Bronson picture that looks good but finally doesn't quite work.,2/4
13679,St. Trinian's,"Surprisingly enjoyable comedy with strong comic performances, lively direction and several decent gags.",3/5
13680,St Trinian's II: The Legend of Fritton's Gold,"Cheap, ramshackle entertainment that's nevertheless imbued with affection.",2/5
13681,St. Vincent,Bill Murray is award-worthy in a tailor-made part.,8/10
13682,Stage Beauty,"A bawdy, rude film that wins us over with sheer energy.",4.5/5
13683,Stage Door,"A stellar cast, superb direction, and a screenplay even better than the stage play on which it was based, all add up to one of the best movies about show business -- or about women living together -- ever made.",5/5
13684,Stage Fright,"Stage Fright rocks hard, sings proud, and leaves audiences begging for a wild, bloody encore.",8/10
13685,Stake Land,"Stake Land is, in the end, one of the most fiercely original (and thoroughly engrossing) horror films to come around in quite some time...",3.5/4
13686,Stalag 17,The thing that will stay with you about this one is clearly William Holden's performance.,3.5/4
13687,Stalingrad,"If you're familiar with the historical specifics, Stalingrad is a reasonably engrossing war drama in the style of Days of Glory, well-played and with moments of vivid patriotic spectacle that look like an army recruiting poster come to life.",3/5
13688,The Stalking Moon,Talkative and thoughtful Western.,C+
13689,Stan Helsing,How low can the genre-spoof genre go?,1/5
13690,Stand and Deliver,"There were moments in Stand and Deliver that moved me very deeply and other moments so artificial and contrived that I wanted to edit them out, right then and there.",2.5/4
13691,Stand by Me,"It's as effective in 2009 as it was upon its initial release, and the richness of its tapestry, densely woven from human emotions and character interaction, ensure it will never lose that relevance.",3.5/4
13692,Stand Clear Of The Closing Doors,An indirect tribute to the 1951 independent landmark The Little Fugitive,3/4
13693,Stand Up Guys,"Christopher Walken, Al Pacino, and Alan Arkin play the film's three flamboyant leading characters with a tacit admission that the tongue-in-cheek crime drama at hand reflects the disappearance of their own group of iconic actors.",B
13694,Standard Operating Procedure,"With his trademark use of slow-motion images and direct-to-camera interviews, Errol Morris spells out the extent of one of the biggest cover-ups in modern U.S. history.",A
13695,Standing in the Shadows of Motown,There are suckers out there for the film's brand of shrink-wrapped nostalgia. I'm not one of them.,1.5/4
13696,Standing Ovation,"It's amateurish, woefully acted by a majority of the cast, and features music even Miley Cyrus would be embarrassed to sing, but it's certainly kooky. Compellingly so at times.",D+
13697,"Standing Up, Falling Down","This could've just been your generic small town homecoming comedy as it hits a lot of the cliched tropes of one, but what makes it stand out is the duo and the script.",3.5/5
13698,Standoff,"Tasty trash talk and one-liners, solid cast, dull thriller.",1.5/4
13699,Stanley & Iris,"There is also a good supporting cast here, and Fonda is effective in her role. But it's DeNiro who shines with a very affecting performance, as well as a natural chemistry with Fonda.",3/4
13700,Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures,"Informative, entertaining, and somewhat maddening.",3.5/5
13701,Star 80,A truly disturbing performance by Eric Roberts,3/5
13702,The Star Chamber,directed with pace and style by Peter Hyams and beautifully photographed by Richard Hannah,3/4
13703,Star Kid,Star Kid is aimed straight for the youth market and that is probably where it will stay.,1.5/4
13704,Star Maps,Star Maps reads like a collision involving three or four scripts in different stages of development.,2/4
13705,Star Trek,"The most exhilarating Trek to date marks a new future for Kirk and co. If this can boldly go on to seek out ideas to match its speed and style, a franchise is reborn.",4/5
13706,Star Trek Beyond,"I can think of no better way to celebrate Star Trek's 50th anniversary than with this film, which embraces everything that's great about the series.",8.4/10
13707,Star Trek: First Contact,A good popcorn movie.,2.5/4
13708,Star Trek Generations,"Everything this picture does differently is a piece of a potentially exciting story, but there just isn't any glue to hold this model Enterprise together.",2.5/4
13709,Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"Star Trek II added hefty doses of action, adventure, and suspense, injecting life into a concept that had been left moribund by its first big-screen feature.",3.5/4
13710,Star Trek III - The Search for Spock,Familiarity breeds contempt since this is not really a notable entry in the Star Trek series.,2.5/4
13711,Star Trek: Insurrection,"Insurrection offers endless pleasure and inside jokes for the hardcore fans, but it's less urgent than First Contact, the dynamic last installment of the series.",B
13712,Star Trek Into Darkness,It's a rousing adventure and Abrams has laid the platform for a healthy and long lasting franchise.,3.5/5
13713,Star Trek IV - The Voyage Home,"An effective and enjoyable sample of entertainment -- not good science fiction, but a lightweight piece of comic fantasy utilizing characters so familiar that they feel like old friends.",3/4
13714,Star Trek - Nemesis,"Good, old-fashioned idiocy, ripped from yesterday's headlines.",1.5/5
13715,Star Trek: The Motion Picture,"So okay, perhaps the plot is somewhat substandard but the glorious special effects thrown up by director Robert Wise ... and a no doubt expert team of special effects craftsmen actually makes this one well worth seeing.",3/5
13716,Star Trek V - The Final Frontier,I liked what it seemed to me the film had said.,6/8
13717,Star Trek VI - The Undiscovered Country,"For a movie that begins with such promise, The Undiscovered Country ends with a whimper.",2.5/4
13718,Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"Watching this movie will help you relive your childhood, or help make new memories with your own kids.",4/4
13719,Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace,I could still have enjoyed it if only there were actors or characters strong enough to stand out against this computer enhanced backdrop.,2/4
13720,Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones,"While the film is clearly a step up from Menace, it still has its weak points.",B+
13721,Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"An unexpectedly sweet pleasure... a dark and gripping slice of space opera, it successfully avoids the pitfalls of its predecessors.",B+
13722,Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"The film is a huge, rousing finale that resolves all plot twists, settles all accounts, reunites old friends and sweeps to a climax that all but blows the theater apart.",3/4
13723,Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens,"Yes, it helps that the core group of original actors has returned, but it's more the energy, humor and simplicity of direction that has been recaptured. It's the overall vibe.",B+
13724,Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"On the whole, this is a great step forward for the franchise - it's deeper, it's darker and it has porgs.",4/5
13725,Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,The Rise of Skywalker [unfortunately] becomes forgettable nostalgia-pushing fodder.,2/5
13726,Starbuck,"Scott deftly balances David's ridiculous mission with moments of real tenderness, making for several heartfelt moments that help carry you past the fact that such a situation couldn't possibly have the ending it does.",3/4
13727,Starcrash,Sexy Caroline Munro is the only reason to watch.,2/5
13728,StarDog and TurboCat,"The backdrops and character designs are fairly basic, but there's a smattering of wit that should help the film find its family audience.",3/5
13729,Stardust,A mixed bag of triumphs and failures.,2.5/4
13730,Stardust Memories,It is a fairly brutal and stylized account of the miseries of a famous comedian/director.,5/5
13731,Starfish,"An alluring and cathartic entry into the sci-fi/horror genre, Starfish plays to the beat of its own drum and ironically makes the end of the world seem quite beautiful.",6.5/10
13732,Stargate,A matinee movie for the kids and little else.,2.5/4
13733,Stark Raving Mad,"Stark Raving Mad is a great comedy and one of the better recent heist flicks; more importantly, it's one of the best direct-to-video movies I've seen lately.",4/5
13734,Starlet,Starlet contains enough provocative subtext to deliver on its themes about the challenges of communication.,B+
13735,Starman,Starman is more of a love story than a sci-fi movie. Take your girlfriend.,2.5/4
13736,Starred Up,"This isn't Mackenzie's most interesting work, but you could do much worse for an issue movie.",B-
13737,Starry Eyes,"Starry Eyes balances Hollywood satire and splattery gore in a way that's both fresh and inviting, taking a typical struggling actress and exploiting her story with everything the horror genre has to offer.",7/10
13738,Stars and Strife,This thoughtful documentary pretends Fake News doesn't hurt the body politic.,3/4
13739,The Stars Fell on Henrietta,"The film lays meticulous groundwork for a payoff that never takes place. The last 20 minutes, which should deliver a big emotional punch, simply do not work.",2/4
13740,Starship Troopers,"Just enjoy the fun of watching Neil Patrick Harris in his audition for Apt Pupil and roll with it, baby.",3.5/5
13741,Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation,"Likely to put off fans of the original, pleasing only those who can reap high entertainment value from the bare-bones ingredients of gore, boobs, and bug-splatter.",2/5

13745,Starter for 10,"Even though it doesn't have an original bone in its body, it's got that dorky goodness you want from a movie about people in their late teens.",B+
13746,Starting Out in the Evening,"Andrew Wagner's mature, sharply observed, quietly intense drama about the shifting relationship between an aging, sickly writer and an ambitious grad student (one third of his age) impresses as one of the best in the dramatic competition series this year",A
13747,Starting Over,"A whole lot better than most of the divorce-centric comedies of this ilk, mainly because it focuses on the characters and not the act of divorce itself.",4/5
13748,Startup.com,"I found Startup.com to be a fascinating portrayal of one company's try for the ring, and the quick road to oblivion.",3.5/4
13749,State and Main,Much like the sophisticated comedies of Preston Sturgess.,B+
13750,State Like Sleep,"A narcotized neo-noir that unfolds with the diverting purposelessness of a forgettable dream, Meredith Danluck's State Like Sleep doesn't really go anywhere.",C
13751,State of the Union,So-so political comedy reflects lesser work by all.,3/5
13752,State Property,Lacks the visual flair and bouncing bravado that characterizes better hip-hop clips and is content to recycle images and characters that were already tired 10 years ago.,0/5
13753,State Property 2,State Property 2's daisy wheel of violence represents a reckless glorification of thug life.,1/4
13754,The Statement,The Statement never delves too deeply into the pitch-black heart of its premise.,2/4
13755,Stateside,This story about mental illness within a romantic relationship wallows in the reckless abuse of the privileges of wealth. It's an unsatisfying cinematic interlude.,4/10

13759,Status Update,"This teen comedy with a ""be yourself"" message is slickly artificial, grinding painfully through extremely well-worn plot mechanics and essentially failing to follow its own message.",2/5
13760,Stay,"Talented actors McGregor, Watts and Gosling are wasted in a pretentious thriller that's located in a space between reality and illusion, life and death, in other words limbo.",D+
13761,Stay,"Neither one of these characters elicits much sympathy from the audience from the very get-go, and this presents von Carolsfeld with a challenge that proves insurmountable by the final frames.",2.5/5

13785,Step Sisters,Step Sisters lacks the willingness to be creative and provide something unique and unexpected its audience.,2/5
13786,Step Up,a surprisingly wholesome bit of fluff with an amiably charismatic cast and a script that should be cited for violating the basic tenets of solid scriptwriting,3/5
13787,Step Up 2 the Streets,Somehow Streets is even more loathsome than its predecessor...offers gaudy choreography more reminiscent of a Kenny Ortega masturbation session than awe-inspiring foot magic.,D-

13800,Stepmom,"Stepmom is not a bad film. It simply doesn't respect the audience's intelligence. It is shallow and manipulative, depending on 'star-power' and sentimentality to carry it where character development and depth of story line cannot.",64/100

13805,Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview,It's a tribute to the singular popularity of Steve Jobs that he's probably the only talking head people would pay to watch for more than an hour.,3/4
13806,Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life,"It's a welcome, often agreeably funny celebration of their great careers. But ultimately it will prove as essential to your appreciation of their comedy-or as skippable-as five minutes of banjo.",B-
13807,Steve McQueen: The Man & Le Mans,"The film forsakes all ambiguity regarding McQueen's psychology by stubbornly defining him as a determined, charismatic womanizer.",2/4

13813,Stiff Upper Lips,"Eric Idle's Merchant Ivory farce is bound to be better tarted up, but this is a good start, as is Le Divorce.",3/5
13814,Stigmata,The film itself only mildly works as a film which inspires horror. What it mostly works as is a rental.,3/5

13816,Still Bill,"Much of the biographical documentary Still Bill, about the singer Bill Withers, is pleasant and even moving.",3/5
13817,Still Breathing,"Another fine attempt at breaking the mold of romantic comedy ... but lacking, oddly, the comedy.",3/5
13818,Still Crazy,"There aren't a lot of plot surprises in Still Crazy, and the ending is more or less as expected -- indeed, as decreed by the comeback genre. But the characters are sharply defined and well-written, and we come to like them.",3/4
13819,Still Here,"While some aspects of this movie feel off the mark, others are spot-on, and the finished product, while not a particularly good mystery, at least becomes a decent, earnest social drama.",3/5

13821,Still of the Night,"Apesar do roteiro estúpido e absurdo, o filme tem boa edição, conseguindo criar suspense em algumas seqüências. Incrível que tenha sido dirigido por Benton depois de Kramer Vs. Kramer.",2/5

13829,Stitches,A Halloween crowd-pleaser that's missing a few tricks and treats.,3/5
13830,Stoker,"Stoker proves that not only can Park Chan-Wook do what others like Polanski and Jeunet have sometimes failed to do, but he can do it with just the same amount of gusto and which panache that made all of his Korean films so damn good.",5/5
13831,Stolen,PBS sponsors will not be disappointed.,2.5/4
13832,Stolen,"Cage is uncharacteristically muted. He seems to have given up on making art long ago; these days, all he wants to do is entertain, and with Stolen, he succeeds, albeit only on the guilty-pleasure level.",C+
13833,Stolen Seas,"An admirably balanced, wide-ranging look at the phenomenon of Somali high-seas piracy ...",3/5
13834,Stolen Summer,"Stolen Summer is no disaster, though. It's merely one more misfire fortunate enough to attract actors like Bonnie Hunt and Aidan Quinn, who almost make it work.",2/4
13835,Stomp the Yard,The film stumbles whenever it fraudulently gives daily life at Truth University the sound and sheen of a Coldplay music video.,2/4
13836,Stone,"It's hard to say which element of this risible drama is sillier - Angus MacLachlan's portentous screenplay, cobbled together from half a dozen of Jim Thompson's lesser potboilers, or Norton's sustained impression of Bubbles from The Wire.",1/5

13840,Stonewall,"Emmerich, who put his own money into making the film, should be cheered for giving it a shot. Unfortunately the compromises he's made leave Stonewall feeling neutered.",2/5
13841,The Stoning of Soraya M.,...reduces an admittedly devastating subject matter to a series of eye-rollingly hoary clichés and stereotypes.,1/4
13842,Stop-Loss,"Sharply uneven, Peirce's film is structurally flawed in the first reels, but it improves considerably in the second half, which documents the dramatic effects of a controversial, little known government policy on a cligue of friends.",B
13843,Stop Making Sense,"A distinct collaboration between Demme and the band, it hits with equal force on visual and aural fronts.",A
13844,Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot,"Spottiswoode directs action well but at about 90 minutes, this film is about 60 minutes longer than its material.",1/5
13845,Stop The Pounding Heart,"It's not quite The Hills, as there's very much the sense that these characters, or versions of them, do actually exist, and Minervi is clearly fascinated in their realities, but there simply isn't enough here to really engage.",1.5/5
13846,Storage 24,"There's enough gore, ideas and self-aware absurdity here to make it something a bit more enticing than merely Alien: The EastEnders Redux.",3/5
13847,Stories We Tell,"Sarah Polley's brave quest to uncover her family's deepest secrets unfolds like a thriller, one where the resolution is literally part of her DNA.",4/4
13848,Storks,"Uneven, but laugh-out-loud Looney Tunes wacky when it works.",2.5/4

13852,The Story of Us,It's so crammed with flashbacks that it loses momentum.,2.5/4

13854,Storytelling,"With a confrontational stance, Todd Solondz takes aim on political correctness and suburban families.",3/4
13855,Straight Outta Compton,Watching Straight Outta Compton ... it feels like watching The Avengers of hip hop biopics. Every character ... gets his own dramatic introduction.,7/10
13856,The Straight Story,"The Straight Story is a wonderfully simple, impossible to dislike slice of warm, eccentric Americana.",3.5/4
13857,Straight Talk,What's really wrong with Straight Talk is a failure of nerve. The screenplay is so painfully conventional that it's clear nobody involved with the movie wanted to push it into new ground or let it take chances.,2/4
13858,Straight Time,"Dustin Hoffman finally gave the unquestionably great performance everyone had been expecting from him. Unfortunately, few people saw it.",5/5
13859,Straight to Hell,"Straight to Hell is simply a record of aimless behavior, of a crowd of pals asked to dress up like cowboys and mill about on a movie set.",1.5/4

13862,Stranded,"It may suggest an Alien incarnate, but once you get past its exterior, it's as empty as outer space.",1.5/4
13863,Stranded: I Have Come from a Plane That Crashed on the Mountains,The film's care in telling the story produces a real sense of condemnation for the invasiveness of the media after the survivors return.,3.5/4
13864,The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry (Guilty of Murder?),Darkly poignant while remaining on message.,B
13865,Strange Bedfellows,one of the best Australian films in years.The teaming of Hogan and Michael Caton is just sublime.,4/5

13889,Stray,"Despite its flaws, this curious little hybrid is bound to intrigue and has enough going on to be worth seeking out by genre fans.",3/5
13890,Stray Bullets,What distinguishes Stray Bullets from so many other low-budget crime films is Jack Fessenden's sense of quietness.,2.5/4
13891,Stray Dolls,A taut and stylish thriller that manages to draw fresh blood from some very familiar territory.,B
13892,Streamers,"It goes partway toward realizing the full effect of a stage play as a film, then botches the job by the overabundant use of film techniques, which dismember what should be an ensemble performance.",2/5

13899,Streets of Blood,"a direct-to-video Festival of the Absurd so over-the-top, so incompetently made, so lacking in decent taste and common sense that the only thing missing to keep it from late-night Skinemax is a couple of sleazy softcore sex scenes",1/5

13902,Strictly Business,"There are moments that work, and others that do not (no young man, not even Waymon, could be as uncoordinated on a dance floor as he seems to be). But beneath the plot, which is routine, are a lot of assumptions that are not.",2.5/4
13903,Strike (Stachka),"Lemming cinema: tragic, brutish, and inexorable.",4/4
13904,Strike,"A modestly entertaining stop-motion family film with a fuzzily retro homemade aesthetic and a warming gentle Englishness: decent enough, but stretched perilously thin.",3/5

13925,The Stuff,"The Stuff is a wildly ambitious movie that fails because it forgets to attend to its bottom line. Before you can make a clever, funny, satirical horror film, first you have to make a horror film.",1.5/4
13926,The Stunt Man,"The Stunt Man is the most exuberant piece of kinetic filmmaking ever produced. I daresay it's also one of the best American films of the 1980s, and, ironically, one of the most overlooked and unknown.",5/5

13932,Sublime,"Relatively-sophisticated for a sci-fi horror flick, this psychological thriller scares the bejesus out of you while subtly using malpractice as metaphor for a generally unacknowledged aspect of American culture.",2.5/4
13933,Submarine,"A superb British comedy, and the sleeper hit of the Toronto International Film Festival.",9/10
13934,Submerged,"Submerged has a great premise, which it promptly proceeds to screw up in every manner conceivable.",1.5/4
13935,Submergence,"It's a love story, it's a spy thriller, it's an underwater adventure, it's about terrorism, it's about climate change, it's about being ghosted by text (!). But ultimately - sadly, predictably - it's also a bit of a mess.",2/5

13946,"Suddenly, Last Summer","Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) is director Joseph L. Mankiewicz' compelling adaptation by Gore Vidal of Tennessee Williams' 1958 Southern drama-one act play. This lurid, somber, ground-breaking and fascinating melodrama concerned terrible secrets...",A

13954,Sukai Kurora (The Sky Crawlers),"The technically proficient The Sky Crawlers is nice to look at and listen to...but by relying on zombified blank-slate characters, Oshii makes a point at the expense of engagement, much less entertainment. [Blu-ray]",2.5/4

13985,Sunset,"Half of the movie wants to be cheerful, and the other half seems morbid and disenchanted.",2/4
13986,Sunset,Dialogue-heavy movies are not a bad thing as long as the dialogue reaches Sorkin or Mamet-like heights. Sunset fails to reach levels of profound.,3/10

13990,Sunset Song,"A wistful remembrance of the joys and sorrows, triumphs and tragedies that mark a human life. You suspect it is a film with the force to linger and grow in the memory.",4/5
13991,Sunshine,"The narrative is, like all of Garland's work, a series of contrived plot points leading to an insane conclusion.",2.5/5
13992,Sunshine Cleaning,"The performances are all amiable and sympathetic enough, but Sunshine Cleaning is nothing if not the Ghost of Sundance Past.",2/5
13993,Sunshine State,"An effective, character-driven drama about real people facing real situations on an island in Florida faced with the encroachment of developers.",3/4
13994,Sunshine Superman,An agreeable documentary...,2.5/4
13995,The Super,"What's finally depressing about The Super is that it doesn't have the nerve to be any one thing. It wants to be crude and rude, but it ends with sentiment. It wants to be about whites and blacks, but is incurious about the lives of its black characters.",2/4
13996,Super,"Gunn's script has more in common with Watchmen or Defendor, though he plays the idea for queasy laughs rather than psychological insight. And truth be told, those laughs are pretty great, thanks to the go-for-broke commitment of both leads.",4/5
13997,Super High Me,"Comedian Doug Benson determines what it would be like to get high for thirty days. What would this prove? Probably nothing, but it was really funny to watch.",B

14000,Super Capers,Nothing here works.,1/4

14002,Super Duper Alice Cooper,This competent but underwhelming portrait of the 70s/80s rock star sticks to the usual wave-graph structure of a thousand other rock bio-docs ...,2/5
14003,Super Size Me,A hilarious and often terrifying look at the effects of fast food on the human body.,4.5/5
14004,Super Size Me 2: Holy Chicken!,A smug odyssey of know-it-all-ism that yields a scant few factoids we didn't already learn from his first film.,2/5
14005,Super Troopers,"It may be a 100-minute brain-cell vacation, but, mamma mia, it's funny.",B
14006,Super Troopers 2,On a first viewing Super Troopers 2 at least manages to avoid many of the pitfalls that harm other comedy sequels.,3/5
14007,Superbad,"Gloriously profane, Superbad, Mottola's follow-up to Daytrippers, takes one of the most disreputable genres--the teenage sex comedy--and detonates it through a shrewd and unapologetic mixture of the uproarious and outrageous.",B+
14008,Supercon,"It's hard to take any of Supercon's over-the-top silliness seriously, and the increasingly-bizarre hijinks are just funny enough to recommend for open-minded folks not easily offended by patently politically-incorrect fare.",2/4
14009,Supercop,Supercop is at its most banal when it apes the Western action style and at its best when Jackie is interacting with the scenery and props around him.,B+
14010,Supercross,A Clear Channel shill.,0.5/4
14011,Superfly,This is a quintessential blaxploitation film. And it's fun as hell to watch.,3/4
14012,Superfly,Alex Tse's script adheres to the basic outline of the original while sprinkling in some fresh touches. Director X nimbly moves the various chess pieces of the plot about while showing a distinctive flair for outlandish action sequences.,3/4

14035,Surveillance,"This is a sadistic film, so be warned.",5/10
14036,Survival of the Dead,"For those who watch Romero's zombie movies for the thrill of the kill, there are plenty of scenes to entertain. [It} is (arguably) one of the best in the series",4.5/5

14039,Surviving Picasso,"When it is over we are left with the conclusion that if Picasso had not been a great artist, this story would not have much mattered; as a beast toward women, he was nothing special.",2.5/4
14040,Surviving Progress,"In an ironically overpopulated documentary genre, it's a fresh approach.",3.5/5
14041,Surviving the Game,"Cheesy take-off of ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" although it's got a lot of low-rent b-movie energy.",2/5

14045,Susan Slept Here,"One scene finds Debbie Reynolds using the golden head of the trademarked Oscar statuette as a makeshift hammer to crack walnuts. In Hollywood, that may have been as shocking as the sight of the desecrated statue of the Virgin Mary in 'The Exorcist.'",3.5/4
14046,Susanne Bartsch: On Top,"Auntie Mame once insisted that ""life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death."" That sentiment is echoed in a new documentary about a nonfictional Mame, Susanne Bartsch, who reigned in New York during the post-Warhol era.",3/4

14050,Suspended Animation,Hancock directed several memorable episodes of the 80s edition of The Twilight Zone and here he seems to confuse cliffhangers for plot twists.,2/4
14051,Suspiria,"There are smart moments of fear and subliminal shivers of disquiet, the dance sequences are good and of course Guadagnino could never be anything other than an intelligent film-maker. But this is a weirdly passionless film.",3/5
14052,Suzi Q,A fan-servicing but not necessarily hagiographic documentary...,3/5
14053,Swades,"The slow-burning Swades requires a bit of patience from its viewers, but such an investment is a minimal expense when the payoff is richly rewarding.",3/4
14054,Swallow,"This bracing look at the oppressiveness of gender roles may feel a bit familiar for most of its running time, but the film's breathless final passage suggests...that the 21st century might offer bold new endings for such regrettably timeless stories.",B

14060,Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,"Dark, haunting, and visionary, Sweeney Todd reps Tim Burton's best film since Ed Wood and his most challenging teaming with Johnny Depp. A mesmerizing, Oscar-caliber work that should satisfy Sondheim's fans and bring new recruits.",A
14061,Sweet Bean (An),"I must confess to feeling exasperated by the sentimentality and stereotype being served up. The film has an impeccable technical finish, but it is insipid, contrived, solemn, and ever so slightly preposterous.",2/5

14074,Sweetness in the Belly,"This is a well-crafted, Bechdel-passing film that prioritizes an intersectional female friendship, yet Lilly remains nothing but our Trojan horse into the 1980s Ethiopian refugee crisis.",2.5/4
14075,Swept Away (Travolti da un Insolito Destino nell'Azzurro Mare d'Agosto),At once too simple and too convoluted to truly take off.,2/4
14076,Swept from the Sea,Part of the problem is the story. It's just not much of one. Fortunately we've got Cornwall -- and Rachel Weisz -- to look at and John Barry's lush score to listen to.,2/4

14087,Swing Vote,Lots of booze in mostly winning political comedy.,3/5
14088,Swingers,"The acting is fantastic from everyone, epsecially Favreau and Vaughn: Favreau shows great comic flair as the neurotic, down-on-his-self-esteem guy; and Vaughn is just, well, ""money"" (word for cool in their clique).",4.5/5

14117,Tabloid,"Tabloid is nothing more than a lark, the equivalent of glancing at the goofy headlines in the checkout line and then forgetting all about them.",B
14118,Tadpole,"At the center of the film, Stanford is a revelation.",3.5/5
14119,Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War,Melodramatic and exciting view about a war (in Korea) rarely filmed.,A-
14120,Tag,...a film that is not only funny but rather exciting in its workings...,17/20
14121,Tai Chi Hero,Stephen Fung's pop-up graphics and jazzy fight scenes feel part of an unwieldy mix in which the director just throws whatever half-baked conceits up on the screen he feels like.,2/4
14122,Tai Chi Zero,"The story's fundamentals are solid, and the battles between this village of kung fu experts and an army of 19th century technophiles are so good that the inevitable sequel (already in the works) will be welcome.",B
14123,Tail Lights Fade,"Sure, it's a misfire, and that's a shame because the genus of something good is present.",2/5

14128,Take Me to the River,You can't help but feel all the palpable joy is eliding some darker realities that would lend the copious musical performances a deeper resonance.,3/5
14129,Take Me To The River,"""Take Me To The River"" is ultimately about dark family secrets coming up out of the murky weeds. But those expecting these enigmas to break the water's surface with clarity might want to look elsewhere.",B-
14130,Take Shelter,Take Shelter [is] successful as both a kitchen sink drama and supernatural thriller.,A

14132,Take This Waltz,"Take this Waltz confirms Polley as a serious, intelligent talent.",4/5
14133,Take Your Pills,"[Klayman's] movie is so preoccupied with the idea of competitive advantages that its ""Harrison Bergeron"" analysis spares little thought for the people who just need some help to be themselves.",C-
14134,Taken,"There's a proper debate to be had about the validation of torture in so many films. 'We used to outsource torture,' ex-CIA spy Bryan (Liam Neeson) says, 'but it was unreliable.'",6/10
14135,Taken 2,"An abject failure as both a slick actioner and a familial drama, Taken 2 signs its series' own death warrant.",2/5
14136,Taken 3,Being on the run from American cops instead of wonky-shooting Albanians might not seem like much of a change but it's just enough to make Bryan interesting again.,3/5
14137,Takers,"A crackling crime drama assembled from a scrap heap of hoary cliches, Takers proves that everything old can sometimes really be new again.",3/4
14138,Taking Care of Business,A series lame jokes and clunky plot machinations that would strike as cynical were they not so obviously desperate.,0.5/4
14139,Taking Chance,Does this really tell us much that isn't patently obvious to anybody with a brain and a heart?,2/5
14140,Taking Lives,There's a reason why the poster for Taking Lives is better than the movie itself-those lips ain't made for talking.,1.5/4
14141,Taking Sides: Le cas Furtwängler,"Szabo effectively dramatizes what might look on paper like a dry, philosophic query.",B+
14142,Taking Woodstock,"Alas, the fun does not last. Once the concert starts and Elliot has his inevitable LSD trip and introduction to free love, the film drops the comedy for a needless coming-of-age denouement.",3/5
14143,Talaash,"This patchwork script had a certain promise to it, packed with characters and story threads that don't really lead anywhere. But the film has a decidedly Eastern sense of pace. It's slower than slow...",1.5/4
14144,The Tale of Despereaux,"Despereaux feels hand-drawn but better, cartoony in all the right ways and lushly, perfectly stylized.",3.5/5
14145,Tale of Tales (Il racconto dei racconti),"Tale of Tales dances on a razor's edge between funny and unnerving, with sequences of shadow-spun horror rubbing up against moments of searing baroque beauty. The result is a fabulously sexy, defiantly unfashionable readymade cult item.",4/5

14153,Tales from the Hood 2,"Incendiary, highly entertaining.... An over-the-top premise, delivered with gusto.",B+
14154,Tales From the Script,"A must see for anyone with a script or an intention to write one. It's also likely inspiring, in a tough love sort of way, for anyone with any kind of ambition. I enjoyed it.",3.5/4
14155,Tales of the Night,"Shot through with romance and glimpses of the kind of silly humour that made A Town Called Panic (2009) so popular, children and adults should be kept quite happy by this solid, intelligent family film.",4/5
14156,Talihina Sky: The Story of Kings of Leon,An insight into an America that many may associate more readily with Steinbeck than the 21st century.,3/5

14159,Talk to Her,Almodovar suggests the need for spiritual invention regardless of the nature of one's crippledom.,3.5/4
14160,Talk to Me,"Though a biopic, Lemmons' third film is most effective when eschewing the genre's rise and fall mythmaking conventions to explore race, status and celebrity through the tale of the 1960s African-American disc jockey.",B
14161,Le Grand Blond avec Une Chaussure Noire (The Tall Blond Man with One Black Shoe),"Tall Blond Man is just too relaxed, too confident of its own cool; comedy has to take more risks than this one does.",2.5/4
14162,Tall Girl,"Tall Girl doesn't attempt to conflate tallness with marginalized groups, but instead points out the absurdity of how teenage life makes everyone feel less than.",3.5/5
14163,The Tall T,A marvelous but bleak psychological Western.,B+
14164,Tall Tale,"A children's movie with enough gumption, fire and wit to warm the cockles of an adult heart.",3/4
14165,Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,"The cast is great, and when they're in the midst of one of those manic improvisational furies that made Anchorman so funny, The Ballad of Ricky Bobby is a riot.",4/5
14166,Tallulah,"Their work together is the vibrant source of the film's appeal, and ""Tallulah"" is at its best when the plot recedes and we get to see Page and Janney's characters testing their tolerance and eventual affection for one another.",B+
14167,Tamara,Tamara fails to approximate the lascivious sadism or the campy hysteria of its forefathers.,1/4
14168,Tamara Drewe,"The deadly sins of envy, lust and salacious gossip in deepest rural England provide the motor for Stephen Frears's black romp, featuring vivacious former Bond girl Gemma Arterton in the title role of the youthful scribe.",4/5
14169,Tammy,"As much as Melissa McCarthy is a presence worth watching in almost anything, it is difficult to get too excited about the low-key, wishy-washy ""Tammy.""",2/4
14170,Tammy's Always Dying,Tammy's Always Dying is about a mother-daughter relationship at its core.,4/5
14171,Tampopo,Tampopo is one of those utterly original movies that seems to exist in no known category.,4/4
14172,Tangerine,"Utilizing underseen subjects, he captures their world in a thoughtful and artful way, and it also happens to be a damn fun ride.",A-
14173,Tangerines,"A most effective antiwar movie though an oversimplification that seems to say that if you get two enemies to sit down with each other over soup, shashlik and a hard-boiled egg, a peace treaty will soon emerge.",A-
14174,Tangled,"An appropriately commingled sense of classic sentimentality and contemporary, gender-equal romance and adventure meet in Tangled, which underscores the still existent pleasures of traditional storytelling.",3.5/5
14175,Tango & Cash,"A party gathering and a few drinks and your night could be set. Sober practicality, however, may get the better of you though as you wade through mysogyny, racism and homophobia.",2/5
14176,The Tango Lesson,"Most dances are for people who are falling in love. The tango is a dance for those who have survived it, and are still a little angry about having their hearts so mishandled. The Tango Lesson is a movie for people who understand that difference.",3.5/4
14177,Tank Girl,In the end there are a few too many formulas and too few surprises.,C+
14178,Tanna,"This is a film that walks the line between elemental simplicity and corny formula, especially when the stars exchange glances in close-up accompanied by Antony Partos' rhapsodic music.",2.5/5
14179,Tanner Hall,The story is involving but the character are types rather than authentic individuals.,C+
14180,The Tao of Steve,"One of the things I like about the movie is the wit of its dialogue, the way sentences and conversations coil with confidence up to a conclusion that is totally unexpected.",3/4
14181,Tap,"Almost everything that happens in the movie is borrowed, more or less frankly, from old movie lore. In a way, that's also a strength: This is a musical about musicals, as well as being a tap dance movie about tap dancers.",3/4
14182,Tap World,"Director Dean Hargrove's claim to fame was inventing ""Matlock."" After sitting through ""Tap World,"" I can assure you it still is.",2/5
14183,Tape,A failure of a low-budget project if ever there was one.,1.5/5
14184,Tape,"Kampmeir's made a lean, disturbing #MeToo tale that should be the last thing any acting class shows its students before graduation",2.5/4
14185,Tapeheads,"All of these elements have been lifted off the shelf of exhausted cliches, given a quick dusting, and plugged directly into the movie.",1.5/4
14186,Taps,"Fans of Penn and Cruise should enjoy this very early glimpse at their heroes, and Hutton (one of Hollywood's all-time most underrated actors) holds the movie together.",73/100
14187,Targets,"Clever, effective combination of gun violence and old-time horror movies.",5/5
14188,Tarzan,"It is the movie's animation, a technological tour de force that uses computers to enhance, not replace, traditional drawings, that almost upstages everything else.",3.5/4
14189,Tarzan,"If kids are captivated by the slight, over-explained story of Tarzan and Jane versus evil mercenaries, I'll be a monkey's uncle.",2/5
14190,Tarzan & Jane,Commercially blatant.,1.5/5
14191,Tarzan and the Lost City,"If this is truly 'A new Tarzan for a new generation,' then everyone falling into the Generation X category should be incredibly offended. I know I am.",0/4
14192,Tarzan Escapes,Superior Tarzan flick that might have been great before it was censored.,4/5

14196,Taste the Blood of Dracula,Yet another tired Chris Lee Dracula romp,1/5
14197,Tater Tot & Patton,"Unfortunately, it's too committed to the usual indie routines to really give us something new.",3/10
14198,Tatsumi,A touching tribute interweaves with tough storytelling in Eric Khoo's poignant portmanteau riff on Japanese graphic artist Yoshihiro Tatsumi's works.,4/5

14200,Taxi,"Nothing really works here, from the ludicrous traffic choreography to the deeply irritating Fallon.",1.5/5

14202,Taxi to the Dark Side,"This is a film to make you furious, though it never lectures.",9/10
14203,Tchoupitoulas,"Shooting in what sometimes approximates a semi-inebriated haze, and emphasizing the overlapping of diverse sounds coming from different quarters, Tchoupitoulas almost does manage to transcend the sight and sound limitations of cinema.",8.5/10
14204,Tea With the Dames (Nothing Like a Dame),The laughter and pure hysteria are infectious in this wildly enjoyable film.,5/5
14205,Teacher,So real it leaves bruises.,3/4
14206,Teacher of the Year,"It's a grade above most high school comedies that trade on sexualized teens, a laugh-out-loud, sweetly-irreverent-but-never-raunchy look at education from the inside out.",B+
14207,Teachers,An insult to real teachers with very few truths.,2/5
14208,Teacher's Pet,"Pitched somewhere between cringe-worthy Disney treacle and the sublime discomfort of ""Ren & Stimpy.""",2.5/4

14210,Team America: World Police,Do NOT take your children to this movie!!!,3.5/4
14211,Fah talai jone (Tears of the Black Tiger),A deliberately laboured plot is offset by some fascinating action sequences.,3/5
14212,Tears of the Sun,"The very things that make ""Tears of the Sun"" a riveting thriller destroy its attempt to become a powerful drama. Yet, I admire it immensely for its determination to be unique and original.",2.5/4
14213,Ted 2,"While I stayed mostly stony-faced through both the original Ted and this sequel, professional duty obliges me to recognise MacFarlane as a genuine eccentric with a certain amount of flair.",2/5
14214,Ted,A no-brainer for anyone who appreciates Seth McFarlane's brand of humor but also for anyone just looking for solid unadulterated laughs which it delivers in spades.,8/10
14215,Ted Bundy,"This piece of Channel 5 grade trash is, quite frankly, an insult to the intelligence of the true genre enthusiast.",1.5/5
14216,Teddy Bear,"From its title to its closing caress, Teddy Bear skates perilously close to the cliff's edge of mawkish sentiment.",2.5/4
14217,Teen Beach Movie,"The push-and-pull between the two [main characters] is a delightful dynamic, setting the tone for other fantastic character interplays and some entertaining turns of events.",4/5
14218,Teen Spirit,"What's so brave and exciting about Max Minghella's directorial debut is that it refuses to compromise on either end, a sweet pop spectacle at once both proudly generic and unafraid to be itself.",B

14224,Teenage,Mesmerising.,4/5
14225,Teenage Badass,It's the kind of movie that substitutes characters being jerks to each other for actual humor.,C
14226,Teenage Cocktail,"John Carchietta nails the more subtle, painful aspects of teenhood. That's a harder thing to pull off than a grindhouse flick, which makes Teenage Cocktail an impressive, if slightly uneven, debut.",B-
14227,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,"Entirely hollow, poorly put together, and will require an audience on its level of stupidity to survive. Don't be one of its supporters.",1/5
14228,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II - The Secret of the Ooze,"If you're a kid, you're going to see it. If you're a parent you may have no choice.",2/4
14229,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III,Even kids are likely to respond to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III with less enthusiasm than they did to the first two films in this series.,1.5/4
14230,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows,"This second live-action film [is] a blend of kinetic violence, bizarre aliens and actors the calibre of Laura Linney wondering what on earth they've got themselves into.",2/5
14231,Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Movie,"This movie is nowhere near as bad as it might have been, and probably is the best possible Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movie.",2.5/4
14232,Tees Maar Khan,Most jokes fall flat. Except when directed at Bollywood itself.,1/5
14233,Teeth,"[Keeps] the viewer entertained with a mix of suspense and humor, but not exactly 'date night' material, because it's doubtful anyone will be having sex right after seeing it.",7/10

14235,Tekken,"The fight-sequences -- dreamlike and almost-spiritual in the original game -- are relegated to UFC-style octagons, shot like shaky-cam snuff and soundtracked by Insane Clown Posse-wannabees. It'd be headache inducing if it weren't so damn boring.",1/5
14236,Tekkonkinkreet (Tekkon kinkurîto),The movie is a collection of disparate anime parts that never really comes together.,2/4
14237,Teknolust,'A' for creativity but comes across more as a sketch for a full-length comedy.,2.5/4

14242,Telling Lies in America,Kevin Bacon's work as the disk jockey is one of his best performances.,3/4
14243,Telstar (Telstar: The Joe Meek Story),"Against expectation, Nick Moran's stylised biopic of 60s pop producer Joe Meek is a surprising success - even if it's the great cast that saves the day.",7/10
14244,The Temp,"The Temp is as unimaginative as thrillers get, with a plot-by-numbers script and insipid direction.",1.5/4
14245,The Tempest,"Lacks some of the magical qualities that lifts its story into the realms of classic fantasy. But it has two performances, apart from Mirren's, exempt from that criticism.",3/5
14246,Temple Grandin,Anchored by Claire Danes' best performance to date...,4/4
14247,Temptation,Limp pacing and countless shots of Washington's skyline plague the narrative.,2/5
14248,Ten Thousand Saints,"Although it may not come to great conclusions about all of the issues it raises, it does affirm that people are inherently good without coming across like it's selling you something. And that's a very sweet thing to do.",8/10
14249,10 to Midnight,"...a routine police thriller that is, for the most part, slow moving and uneventful.",2/4
14250,Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny,"When called upon the movie rocks, and rocks hard.",4/5

14254,Tequila Sunrise,"An intriguing movie with interesting characters, but it might have worked better if it had found a cleaner narrative line from beginning to end.",2.5/4
14255,Term Life,"An asinine movie that has the premise for a thriller, the tone of a half-hearted neo-noir, and the plot of a daddy-daughter dramedy.",D
14256,Terminal,"Undoubtedly one of 2018's best looking films. It's visually stunning with mesmerizing cinematography, but lacks enough substance to match its dazzling looks.",6.5/10
14257,Terminal Velocity,"You've gotta hand it to Terminal Velocity: This movie may be dumb as a box of shredded wheat, but it has the damnedest action sequence I've seen since Arnold Schwarzenegger blasted the bad guy with the missile in True Lies.",2/4
14258,The Terminator,"The movie's strength is that, like The Matrix, it combines action with ideas.",3.5/4
14259,Terminator 2: Judgment Day,Few films have matched it within the science fiction genre for sheer white-knuckle exhilaration.,3.5/4
14260,Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines,"I was pleasantly surprised and duly impressed. Jonathan Mostow has taken good care of Cameron's baby, showing both respect and homage to the characters and trends.",3.5/4
14261,Terminator Salvation,"Definitely a 'summer blockbuster' and has enough great moments in it to outweigh any groaners that it may also have. In fact, the good moments outweigh the bad about 20 to 1.",9/10

14263,Terminator Genisys,"In 1984's ""The Terminator,"" machines came back from the future to wipe out humanity; with ""Terminator Genisys,"" a whole franchise comes back from the past to water down summer moviegoing.",2/5

14265,Terms of Endearment,"Terms of Endearment (1983) is a comedy/drama classic, an entertaining film, but also a manipulative, soap-operatic melodramatic tearjerker, with an ending similar to Dark Victory (1939) and Love Story (1970). Its tagline was:""Have you come to Terms yet?""",A
14266,Terraferma,Its self-seriousness never allows it to become the realist counterpoint to Aki Kaurismki's tragicomic approach in Le Havre that one initially hopes it will be.,2/4
14267,Terri,"Terri is largely pointless, and while pointlessness isn't necessarily a bad thing in a comedy, it must be accompanied by, well, comedy.",C+

14273,Terror Train,Holds the tension in a bone-chilling manner.,C+

14275,Tess,"Without Mr. Polanski's name in the credits, this lush and scenic Tess could even be mistaken for the work of David Lean.",5/5
14276,Test,"An evocative portrait of an in-between moment of history, one of the periods where no one is quite sure what's going on and everything seems to be in question.",B
14277,Testament,The film's emotional impact is draining and long lasting without showing close-ups of the initial blast with evaporating bodies and mass destruction.,4/5
14278,Testament Of Youth,"Beautifully observed moments, captured gorgeously by Kent, and excellently performed by his cast, make the film linger, adding up to a of mosaic of grief, loss, and anger at the waste of an inhuman conflict, all without showing a single bullet fired.",B+
14279,Tetro,"Coppola's first original script in decades, Tetro is a dense, self-reflexive meditation about life and art, a spectacle that uses the melodrama genre to comment on family, narrative, and magic while paying tribute to Kazan, Fellini and even Almodovar.",B
14280,Tetsuo: The Ironman,Tetsuo and Fetishist's transformation into Iron Man becomes a response to the machinization of the individual in a systematically regimented Japan.,3.5/4

14288,Thank God It's Friday,Interesting as a time-capsule of the disco era.,3/5
14289,Thank You For Playing,"Thank You for Playing also takes the experience of Ryan, Amy and their family and artistically expands it out to a universal audience.",4/5
14290,Thank You for Smoking,...a pleasant enough way to kill 92 minutes (although one has to imagine that Buckley's book packed more of a punch than this).,2.5/4
14291,Thank You for Your Service,"Ultimately, ""Thank You For Your Service"" is commendable and well, serviceable. But it's more of an honorable discharge rather than something you fete with medals of esteem.",C+

14299,That Obscure Object of Desire,"The film culminates with a brilliant last shot for Buuel's last movie -- a fitting end for a man who offended, tantalized, entertained, and shocked so many people for so many years.",4/4
14300,That Old Feeling,"What's in slow motion here is the progress of the plot. Every development is exhausting because we have arrived at it long, long before the characters.",1/4
14301,That Sugar Film,"My main problem with this documentary, which Gameau says is a quest for definitive answers, is that it is so one-sided.",2/5
14302,That Summer,"Lack of a through-line can make the film itself feel a bit dull, especially as it exists in such a rarified atmosphere. But it's also mesmerising.",3.5/5
14303,That Thing You Do!,"It may be too happy and sweet for the cynical crowd, sort of a ""have a nice day"" movie, but if feel good films are your fancy it would be hard to go wrong with this one.",2.5/4
14304,That Uncertain Feeling,Possibly the only lame film Ernst Lubitsch ever made.,2/5
14305,That's Entertainment! III,"The result is a genuinely fascinating film, one that may tell more about MGM musicals, and aspects of American society, than a film devoted to still more highlights from musical numbers that did make their way into films.",3.5/4
14306,That's Entertainment,"It's good, but contrary to the onscreen evidence, MGM did not make all the best musicals.",3/5
14307,"That's Entertainment, Part 2","It's more fluid, with fewer interruptions of the material, and several segments cover purely speaking segments rather than just song and dance.",8/10
14308,That's My Boy,"When your mouth is not making noises similar to laughter, it will be dragging along the theater floor in stunned disbelief.",3.5/5
14309,That's the Way I Like It (Forever Fever),"Turn on the disco ball and crank up the music, and the film sizzles. Otherwise, it drags like an old Lawrence Welk 78 record played on 33 1/3.",2.5/4
14310,That's What I Am,An emotionally affecting coming-of-age drama set in the 1960s about the importance of the many splendored virtue of respect.,4/5
14311,That's What She Said,An embarrassing girls-behaving-badly indie romp you'd expect a group of friends to write after an all-you-can-drink brunch.,0.5/4
14312,"The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T",I recommend it to people of all ages IF they can be young at heart.,2.5/4
14313,The 9th Company (9 rota),"Director Fyodor Bondarchuk handles the action sequences impressively but relies heavily on a bombastic orchestral score and slow-motion effects, while the film's nationalistic sentiments ensure the enemy remains faceless and fanatical.",3/5
14314,The Actress,"George Cukor's screen version of Ruth Gordon's memoirs is well acted by Jean Simmons in the lead and Anthony Perkins (making his screen debut),",B
14315,The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D,"will, one fervently hopes, put an end to Robert Rodriguez's foray in children's films.",1/5
14316,The Amateurs (The Moguls) (Dirty Movie),This film proves that a superb premise and a terrific ensemble cast aren't enough. Writer-director Traeger simply gets it completely wrong.,1.5/5
14317,The Baby,"... the film has the look and feel of a TV cop drama, and a politically incorrect, outlandish storyline that couldn't be filmed today.",3/4
14318,The Backyard,"An x-treme documentary, as riveting as a road accident and a lot more bloody.",5/5
14319,The Best and the Brightest,"It may dawn on you that the film really only has one, big joke up its sleeve, but like The Aristocrats it finds so many great ways to tell it that the punchline rarely matters.",3/4
14320,The Blue Tooth Virgin,"For a film so keen on creating humor off the inaptness of a character's script, Blue Tooth Virgin should have double-checked its own screenwriting chops.",2/4
14321,The Bogus Witch Project,"Take this out to the woods, bury it and be done with",1/5
14322,La demoiselle d'honneur (The Bridesmaid),"It's about the way families behave so strangely, how mama's boys end up more than a little messed up and how women seem to get the short end of the happiness stick.",4.5/5
14323,The Bunker,"The film offers more mayhem than suspense and does not really work beyond the ""something scary in the dark"" level.",3/10
14324,The Cake Eaters,"An old-fashioned minor key drama, ""The Cake Eaters"" is the exact type of film that is the cornerstone of modern American Independent cinema.",A
14325,The Cheetah Girls 2,"Even by Disney Channel standards, this sequel is weak and shrill and not at all fun.",1.5/5
14326,The Company Men,Not 'fun' like 'Up in the Air' but a solid drama about the economic mess that we're in,B+
14327,The Crimson Kimono,It's a satisfactory Fuller work...,B-
14328,The Croods,"Though impressive in many technical and surface ways, it lets us down on the essentials of character and story, and no amount of late-stage father/daughter bonding or vertiginous 3D cliffside tumbling can make up for that.",C+
14329,The Debut,As well-meaning as an after-school special and only slightly more inspired.,2/4
14330,The Desert Of Forbidden Art,"Needless to say, the film is packed with art, as well as interviews with art critics, journalists and the descendents of some of the artists.",3/4
14331,The Eagle,"[VIDEO] ""The Eagle"" is a problematic piece of wartime propaganda that asks the viewer to idolize a manifestation of imperialist destruction as something honorable. Such false devotion reveals a lack of ethical consideration from all parties involved.",C-
14332,The Evil Dead,To say that the Evil Dead movies are not for everyone is an understatement. A strong stomach is required.,3/4
14333,The Fall,...plagued by unreasonably amateurish performances and lackluster scripting.,1.5/4
14334,The Family That Preys,Message-heavy dramedy features fine performances.,3/5
14335,The Fantasticks,Presents an inviting opportunity to 'try to remember' a cinematic art that has sadly been all but lost.,3/4
14336,The Food of the Gods,Giant animal silliness.,1.5/5
14337,The Foot Fist Way,"This is a really small film, shot in 19 days, and it's a little rough around the edges, but it's got a huge comic heart that's undeniable.",4/5
14338,The Gods Must Be Crazy,You'd have to be crazy not to be charmed by this movie - grab a coke and a smile.,4/5
14339,The Great Mouse Detective,"What's fun is the carefree way the animators swing through their story, using the freedom of the cartoon form to blend 19th century realism with images that seem borrowed from more recent special-effects pictures",3/4
14340,The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things,Argento might one day make a good film - this certainly isn't it.,1/4
14341,The Heart of the Game,"It's uplifting and inspiring to see a coach who brings out the best in his girls. Like the documentary Hoop Dreams, this turns out to be a whole lot more than just a movie about basketball.",4/5
14342,The Hero of Color City,"Decent voices, pitifully unimpressive animation in service of a story that barely deserves the label ""story.""",1.5/4
14343,The House By The Cemetery (Quella villa accanto al cimitero),Someone built another house on top of a graveyard. Dummies!,61/100
14344,The Killing of John Lennon,"Piddington has pulled off a delicate balancing act, presenting Chapman as an explosive by-product of our celebrity-obsessed times, while resisting the temptation to validate Chapman's own elaborate self-mythologising.",4/5
14345,The Knack...And How to Get It,"Everything about the film feels genuine and uncalculated, and it finally comes across as one joyous celebration of life and of being alive.",5/5
14346,The Last Run,Downbeat but well-crafted crime thriller.,B
14347,The Left Handed Gun,"A good but disturbing psychological western, well directed by Penn and acted in a strangely fascinating style by Newman.",3.5/4
14348,The Lightkeepers,"A pleasant, if predictable, period piece to be savored as much for the breathtaking seascapes as for the deliberately-paced romantic roundelays.",3/4
14349,The Lost,Makes a great case for being a cult classic...,2.5/4
14350,The Man,"""The Man's"" nebulous title indicates the sloppy nature of an ""action comedy"" movie that emits painfully little of either genre enticement.",D
14351,The Missing Gun,I gotta admit I nodded off a couple times just for a few seconds. I couldn't help it; my eyes were rebelling against this movie.,1/5
14352,The Navigator,"Isn't as sophisticated and satisfying as [Keaton's] best (e.g., The General), but still brilliant slapstick comedy, with a rousing third act and a slam-bang climax.",B+
14353,The Next Man,"Even in a bad film, an uninspired Connery is still watchable.",C
14354,The Nutcracker,"The camera plants itself for a frontal view of the stage, and then there are closeups and reaction shots, all done by the numbers, generating no magic.",2/4
14355,The Other Side of the Mirror - Bob Dylan Newport 1963-1965,a 'must see' for music fans and a necessary addition to the DVD libraries of all Dylan fans,B
14356,Professione: reporter (The Passenger),"The Passenger is not only a great Hollywood movie, it's a great movie in world cinema.",4/4
14357,The Perfect Host,So many engaging twists that any attempt at a detailed synopsis would ruin the movie.,B+
14358,The Pleasure of Being Robbed,Affects an air of expressionistic realism but has no interest in actual believability.,1/4
14359,The Resident,"If all is right in the universe, the only good that will come out of ""The Resident"" is the murder of its director's career before it even starts.",D
14360,The Romantics,Candice Bergen strikes an emotional spark every time she appears onscreen as Lila's uptight mother. Her scenes with Paquin are the best in the film.,3/5
14361,The Safety of Objects,"The film is so energetic (a +) that its body is often ahead of its brain. Still, the movie isn't so sappy that we're forced to resist it.",2.5/4
14362,The Scenesters,Audiences will shrug at the mystery's solution but likely will be eager to see what Berger & Co. do next.,3/5
14363,The Scent of Green Papaya (Mùi du du xanh - L'odeur de la papaye verte),Here is a film so placid and filled with sweetness that watching it is like listening to soothing music.,4/4
14364,The Secret of Kells,"Captivatingly creative but over-fussy in terms of story, this is still an entertaining and accomplished debut.",3/5
14365,The Secret of Roan Inish,"The film is unapologetically sweet and hopeful, but it's said the heart's true home is the water, that its nature is to bob atop the cares of the world like a wooden cradle on the waves.",4/5
14366,La Siciliana Ribelle (The Sicilian Girl),More Cavalleria Rusticana than Gomorra.,2/5
14367,The Singles Ward,"A word of advice to the makers of The Singles Ward: Celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs. And neither do cliches, no matter how 'inside' they are.",2/4
14368,The Social Network,"As socially significant to this generation as films like Network, All The President's Men and The Graduate were in their own time.",5/5
14369,The Story of O,"The standard, with Emmanuelle, against which all late-night Cinemax films are measured.",3.5/5
14370,The Tale of Zatoichi,"serves as a good introduction to the character, establishing his major traits and offering a worthwhile narrative",2.5/4
14371,The Taqwacores,Eyad Zahra's The Taqwacores pays lip service to its characters with the same self-importance of a '90s-era episode of The Real World.,2/4
14372,The Terror (The Haunting) (The Castle of Terror),The Terror is more boring than it is scary.,C-
14373,"Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers",...you've got barely an hour of movie; hardly enough to do much more than cram in the songs and let Mickey and his friends run around a little.,6/10
14374,The Tigger Movie,This Tigger outing feels more like an overblown TV special than a grand theatrical release.,2/5
14375,The Trotsky,Runs 20 minutes too long and several rungs above the head of its target audience.,2/5
14376,The Vanishing of the Bees,Fascinating subject expertly covered.,3/5
14377,The War on the War on Drugs,"Like so much dope humor, Soling's logic is fuzzy, and you'd have to be pretty high to find any of it funny.",1.5/5
14378,The War,This is one of those films so overwrought and overwritten that a perfectly good human story gets swamped in Statements About the Human Condition.,2/4
14379,The Warrior's Way,"If you can't figure out why a clown shooting a ninja is forty kinds of awesome, it's not going to waste time explaining it to you.",B
14380,The Wide Blue Road (La Grande strada azzurra),Another invaluable artifact of cinema history that should be required viewing for anyone with even an ounce of interest in the development of the art form.,B-
14381,The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia,Even those with a soft spot for The Dancing Outlaw will likely have a hard time warming up to The Wild and Wonderful Whites of West Virginia.,2/4
14382,The Yakuza,"A superior action movie, but all the same, it's for audiences that have grown accustomed over the last few years to buckets of blood, disembowelments and severed hands flying through the air.",2.5/4
14383,"The $1,000,000 Duck","$1,000,000 Duck is one of the most profoundly stupid movies I've ever seen.",1/4
14384,The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared,"Alan's life weaves through significant events of the 20th century, recalling naïve, hilarious and unrelentingly ridiculous encounters with Franco, Stalin and Oppenheimer, among others.",4/5
14385,The 10th Victim (La Decima vittima) (The Tenth Victim),"Interesting sci-fi film. Not really successful, but worth a look.",3/5
14386,The 12th Man,Crackling good WWII survival yard with a finale as dazzling as Norway's frozen mountains can provide.,3.5/4
14387,The 15:17 to Paris,"Oh dear. Clint Eastwood, what have you done?",2/5
14388,The 24 Hour War,"Seriously Ford-centric remembrance of ""the greatest rivalry in (endurance) racing,"" Ford vs. Ferrari in the 1960s.",2.5/4
14389,The 24th,It doesn't quite pack as powerful a punch as Willmott's works with Spike Lee but The 24th is still very much a movie for the moment that pinpoints exactly why protests and riots are sadly still necessary,4/5
14390,The 33,"A great tribute to the tragedy, even though it never tries to be an exact retelling of the incident, it doesn't oversell the drama. [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
14391,The 5th Quarter,"It scores points for being that rare ""faith based film"" to show a little edge.",2.5/4
14392,The 9th Life of Louis Drax,"The 9th Life of Louis Drax had potential to be so much more, but the wondrous story at its core is populated with dull and, ironically, lifeless characters.",2/5
14393,The Abandoned,"I was somewhat dissatisfied with the ending, but that sort of thing is subjective, and I encourage everyone to watch The Abandoned to judge for themselves.",3.5/5
14394,The ABCs of Death,"Even through the film's best shorts the project just felt overtly long and fragmented...while some of the shorts warranted a perfect score, others deserved much less.",5/10
14395,The Absent One (Fasandraeberne),Tense right to the end.,4/5
14396,The Accompanist,"Writer-director and star Frederick Keeve is introduced to us, weeping at the keyboard in the opening scene. It won't be long before he isn't crying alone.",1/4
14397,The Accountant,"Director Gavin O'Connor gives old-fashioned story-telling polish, avoiding shakey cameras and excessive angst in the male lead.",3/5
14398,The Act Of Killing,Almost every frame is astonishing.,5/5
14399,The Addams Family,"As quickly as Thing can snap its fingers, we'll soon forget our visit with this version of The Addams Family.",2/4
14400,The Adderall Diaries,"A tonally confused movie that lacks the bravado and grit of its source material. Committed performances from James Franco, Ed Harris, Amber Heard and Christian Slater can't save it.",4/10
14401,The Adventure Club,"Adventure Club has its heart in the right place (its message of forgiveness for reformed bullies and apologetic family betrayers is admirable), but its brain has gone comatose and its adrenal glands never get excited.",1.5/4
14402,The Adventurer: The Curse of the Midas Box,"The film gradually reveals a lot of unsavory motives, which ultimately deflate the buoyant virtues on which the film had blithely coasted.",2/4
14403,The Adventurers,"While the basic ingredients are familiar, Fung endows them with panache and speed, and he punctuates the action with humor.",2.5/4
14404,The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai,"[It] aims for wackiness and weirdness and probably attains it, but to be honest, it is a rather soulless piece of entertainment.",2/4
14405,The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin,"It's not high art (and it's sure not close to ""classic"" status), but Bullwhip presents some old-fashioned family fun that won't have the grown-ups running for cover.",3/5
14406,The Adventures of Milo and Otis,"Granted this is a film aimed at the younger set, say ages 3-6, but still I would have hoped for more.",2/4
14407,The Adventures of Tintin,"Think of ""The Adventures of Tintin"" as a song of innocence and experience, able to combine a sweet sense of childlike wonder and pureness of heart with the most worldly and sophisticated of modern technology.",4.5/5
14408,The African Queen,"There are not two better actors to tackle these roles, and director Huston keeps their story moving without lulls.",88/100
14409,The After Party,"Lots of hip hop cameos, too few laughs to be worth the hangover that follows",1.5/4
14410,The Afterlight,"A quietly intense, engrossing and intelligent drama brimming with haunting imagery and poignant lyricism.",8.199/10
14411,The Aftermath,"You may well enjoy this unusual love story: for its performances, its strong sense of time and place, and its vivid reminder that a war's official end is never really anything of the kind.",3/5
14412,The Age of Adaline,"Stay far away if romantic movies bother you. For everyone else, this very much delivers on its earnest intentions.",3/5
14413,The Age of Stupid,Postlethwaite's battered face is a good metaphor for Earth's ravagement. But the film is too overtly left-wing and anti-US to be of inclusive use.,5/10
14414,The Aggression Scale,Sort of like The Strangers meets Home Alone. Only dead serious and painfully violent.,3.5/5
14415,The Air I Breathe,A breathtakingly bad Altman rip-off that seems like a wholly unintentional parody of multi-narrative films.,0.5/4
14416,The Air Up There,"A lightweight, brainless family movie chronicling the triumph of the underdog.",2/4
14417,The Amazing Catfish,The familiar premise is done with enough intelligence and heartfelt conviction that it rises above its potentially cliché trappings.,2.5/4
14418,The Amazing Spider-Man,"Yet another generation will bear the Spiderman emblem on their lunchboxes and pencilcases, and there's no harm in that. With great power comes great responsibility -- and an endless franchise.",4/5
14419,The Amazing Spider-Man 2,The Amazing Spider-Man 2 seems to know exactly what it's doing. Webb's film is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it.,4/5
14420,The Ambassador,Subversive and incendiary.,4/5
14421,The American,"George Clooney is a somber, guilt-wracked assassin hiding out in mountainous central Italy-but despite the bleak sheen and Anton Corbijn's spatial dexterity, the script goes all Up in the Air.",2.5/4
14422,The American Meme,It is ironic how human the falsity can be.,2.5/5
14423,The American Side,"Even though the genre is tried and true, The American Side constantly remains fresh.",B

14425,The Amityville Horror,"Strange and weird, yes. Scary, no.",4/10
14426,The Amityville Murders,The Amityville Murders wastes historical reverence on a paint-by-numbers ghost story that relies too heavily on eyesore animated effects.,3/10
14427,The Angel,"An espionage tale that's more sturdy and intriguing than thrilling, more ""Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy"" than Netflix's answer to Bourne or Bond.",2.5/4
14428,The Angels' Share,"Like a subtly blended malt, this mixes light and dark to create one of Loach's most life-affirming tales. Funny, frank and it won't give you a splitting hangover.",4/5
14429,The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,Watching The Angriest Man in Brooklyn is about as much fun as repeatedly punching yourself in the face.,2/10
14430,The Angry Birds Movie,The Angry Birds Movie is both the equivalent of a screaming five-year-old and a regressive piece of American propaganda.,1/5
14431,The Angry Birds Movie 2,"Moving beyond the confines of the app's premises, The Angry Birds Movie 2 starts slow but flourishes into breezy, colourful fun.",3/5
14432,The Anomaly,"The over reliance on slo-mo also makes every action sequence repetitive, even with some semi-decent fight choreography on display. The tacked-on love story is so shallow and perfunctory it's almost laughable.",2/5
14433,The Anonymous People,"A well-meaning but uninspiring documentary lobbying for treatment, not incarceration, for addicts",B-
14434,The Anthropologist,"It may not be handled with the rigor that climate change activists would like to see, but it's an entertaining way of putting a human face on a problem while still providing enough important facts to promote thought.",7/10
14435,The Apostate (El Apóstata),Federico Veiroj prefers to let Gonzalo off the hook instead of doubling down on his existential quandaries.,2.5/4
14436,The Apparition,"The movie isn't scary and plays it way too safe, making for an underwhelming experience for this horror fan.",2.5/5
14437,The Apparition (L'apparition),A religious thriller with more concerned with the psychological aspects... of the genre. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
14438,The Arbor,Is the film a drama? Or a documentary? We're not sure.,2/5
14439,The Archer,"Anchored by Bailey Noble's breakout performance, The Archer is a lean and tense thriller that rarely lets up.",6.5/10
14440,Ardor,Sergio Leone meets 'Sounds of the Rainforest' in this wafting new-age western.,2/5
14441,The Argument,If only the set-up was half as amusing as the payoff.,2/4
14442,The Armstrong Lie,Where Gibney's film succeeds is in the way it lays bare the theatre of the Tour de France to mug bystanders like me who assumed it was a straightforward cycling competition.,3/5
14443,The Arrangement,bizarrely disjointed,3/5
14444,The Art of Getting By,"Homework is an epitome of the quirky, coming of age trend at Sundance, a hollow but likable enough comedy headed for modest box office.",2/5
14445,The Art of Racing in the Rain,"Much more at home as a mid-afternoon TV movie, accompanied by a cup of tea and a digestive, it's contrived, leaden and deeply dull.",1/5
14446,The Art of Self-Defense,The Art of Self-Defense manages to clarify the filmmaker's intriguing vision by stuffing it into a remarkably unnerving character study.,B+
14447,The Art of the Steal,"The Art of the Steal is never beautiful, but it's a pleasant enough diversion if you squint a bit or stand far enough back.",2.5/5
14448,The Art Star and the Sudanese Twins,"A worrisome document about the first world view of Third World countries, but what it says about contemporary art gives the movie a rich vein of humour.",4/5
14449,The Artist,"Delightful and lovely, a little gift of cinema.",A
14450,The Aspern Papers,"Landais certainly brought little cinematic verve to ""The Aspern Papers,"" telling the story largely in turgid literary voiceover lifted directly from the original source material.",1.5/5
14451,The Assassin,"If The Assassin is sometimes agonisingly slow, it's also agonisingly well-crafted, and it's an agony that regularly tips into ecstasy as Hou allows us to be lost in the period, people and places he offers us.",4/5
14452,The Assignment,"Once the giddy critical pile-on and hate-watching settles down, the (justified) moral outrage that (re)Assignment tries to thwart will end up being the regrettable and forgettable film's only lasting legacy.",D-
14453,The Atoning,"Less sophisticated than it seems to think, The Atoning is nevertheless an effective little fable whose underlying horrors are very much a part of the real world.",3/5
14454,The Attack,"A wrenching tale of an Arab surgeon assimilated and celebrated in Tel Aviv, who discovers his wife's darkest secret.",B+
14455,The Attorney,"Just when a viewer is lulled into believing ""The Attorney"" is a lighthearted comedy about a doofus of a lawyer, this powerful South Korean feature takes a sharp turn toward brutal political thriller.",3/4
14456,The Audition (Das Vorspiel),"Art, sex and creative competitiveness combine in compelling ways in Weisse's absorbing psychological drama set in the Berlin music world.",4/5
14457,The Automatic Hate,It's a honest and heartfelt look at the lines that society draws and the consequences of crossing them.,4/5
14458,The Autopsy of Jane Doe,Lifeless and lackluster.,D
14459,The Awakening,...an egregiously familiar ghost story that simply isn't able to wholeheartedly justify its existence...,1.5/4
14460,The Awakening of Motti Wolkenbruch (Wolkenbruchs wunderliche reise in die arme einer schickse),"Not without a little cultures-clash rom-com charm, but more grating and over-familiar than anything else.",1.5/4
14461,The Babadook,"With its whimsically ghoulish creation and frightfully real lead performances, The Babadook feels just like that actual nightmare you once had.",9/10
14462,The Babymakers,Chandrasekhar's first tentative venture towards something slightly more sincere is undermined by his irresistible urge to take the piss out of every sequence that might have been played even remotely seriously,C-
14463,The Babysitter,"For those who seek only the most basic diversion of blood and curvy stimulation, The Babysitter might fit the bill this Friday the 13th, but this intended trashy fun is really just trash.",1.5/5
14464,The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer,Sparkling romantic comedy.,4/5
14465,The Bachelors,Beautifully-acted but utterly unsurprising love-recovers-from-grief romance.,2/4
14466,The Backwoods (Bosque de sombras),"Instead of keeping us on the edge of our seats ..., The Backwoods causes the viewer to become the snoozer as it slogs its way to a futile and forgettable conclusion.",2/5
14467,The Bad Batch,"The Bad Batch is expertly constructed and looks great: Amirpour has presumably been inspired by Alma Har'el's documentary Bombay Beach, and has picked up the same atmosphere of bone-dry decay as well as using the actual place as a location.",3/5
14468,The Bag Man,"The premise might make sense, if only hypocritically, but the film abandons this already flimsy parody of macho pride disastrously at the last minute.",2/4
14469,The Ballad of Buster Scruggs,"Buster Scruggs is a singular illustration of what makes the Coen formula so appealing, and a reminder of so many better examples.",B-
14470,The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye,"Losier's portrait, like her extraordinary subject, feels like a work-in progress rather than the final word.",3/5
14471,The Ballad of Lefty Brown,Mosh resurrects the big screen possibilities of a genre in pure visual terms.,B-
14472,The Banana Splits,"The Banana Splits Movie will be controversial -- especially among those who still have a fondness for the original series -- but it mostly sticks the landing, buoyed by a great cast, script and crew.",4/5
14473,The Band's Visit,"One of the pleasant surprises at Cannes Fest this year and a highlight of Israeli cinema, this subtle, wry comedy concerns initial culture clash and miscommunications but then better understanding, when an Egyptian band lands in a remote Israeli town.",A-
14474,The Banshee Chapter,Blair Erickson's The Banshee Chapter is a relentless bit of horror that mixes governmental conspiracies and psychedelic drugs for one hell of a traumatizing trip.,7/10
14475,The Barber,"With a slow-burn sensibility and veteran actor Scott Glenn used to strong effect, this modest thriller will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up",3/5
14476,The Basement,"Armed with a bargain basement budget and access to an actress with a following, co-directors Brian M. Conley and Nathan Ives deliver contained, gruesome horror that is hampered by a largely inert script.",4/10
14477,Bastards,I had the sense that Denis's painstaking approach was little more than an act of concealment; that her actual story was thin and tacky and that her elaborate style was precisely that.,2/5
14478,The Bastards' Fig Tree (La higuera de los bastardos),... more than as a period film set in the Civil War... [Full review in Spanish],3/5
14479,The Battery,Gardner puts the monsters in the background while he concentrates on the growing difficulties between the two friends.,2.5/5
14480,The Battle of Algiers (La Battaglia di Algeri),A riveting look at France's failed attempt to remain a colonial force in Algeria. Re-release.,A-
14481,The Battle of Jangsari,"Visceral and sentimental Korean War as fought by Koreans combat film, on an action and production par with a solid Hollywood B-movie.",2.5/4
14482,The Battle of Pussy Willow Creek,Picture- and letter-perfect send-up of such serious treatments of history as . . . Ken Burns' Civil War. . . The most chuckles over a history lesson since Mel Brooks.,8/10
14483,The Bay,A cut above most found-footage fare...,3/4
14484,The Bay of Silence,You may need to read the book to figure out what's going on here.,C
14485,The Baytown Outlaws,"It's a shame Battles loses his nerve in the final act, weirdly assuming viewers have developed an emotional attachment to material that works best as a cartoon.",C+
14486,The Beach Bum,"There's certainly an audience for this film, but not a big one.",1/5
14487,The Bear,"This is not a cute fantasy in which bears ride tricycles and play house. It is about life in the wild, and it does an impressive job of seeming to show wild bears in their natural habitat.",3/4
14488,The Beast (La bête),"At times the film is also undeniably offensive, pandering to male fantasy, as is the pseudo-rape fantasies the film attributes to its female characters.",2/5
14489,The Beast in the Cellar,The potentially interesting premise is undone by an extremely chatty script.,1.5/5
14490,The Beast With Five Fingers,Really creepy showcase for Lorre with a botched ending.,4/5
14491,The Beat Beneath My Feet,"The highlights of the entire movie are the imaginative pop-video-style sequences, which make clever use of stop-frame animation to bring the duo's songs to life. If only there was the same vim and vigour elsewhere in this otherwise plodding tale.",2/5
14492,The Beat Hotel,"The Beat Hotel was but one of many domiciles, too small to possess anything but their ephemeral bodies.",2/4
14493,The Beatles: Eight Days a Week - The Touring Years,"With the help of some obvious talking heads, and some less predictable ones, [Howard] tells a familiar tale with a surprising and at times thrilling amount of originality.",4/5
14494,The Beautiful Person (La Belle Personne),"The comic swerves and dramatic twists feel at once dutiful and arbitrary, and supposedly intense emotions are explored with the arch, weary detachment of a school assignment.",2.5/5
14495,The Beaver,A perfect match of artist and repertoire.,B
14496,The Beguiled,"Sofia Coppola's American Civil War movie, The Beguiled, turns out to be a comedy as floaty and insubstantial as the dresses that her seven Southern belles wear.",2/5
14497,The Believer,"Such an incredibly ironic turn of events practically begs to be made into a film, and first-time director Henry Bean guides this one very well.",A-
14498,The Believers,"An awesomely silly, tasteless and half-witted movie.",1.5/4
14499,The Belko Experiment,"The Belko Experiment rides a gushing wave of carnage through the elevators of an unsuspecting office building, gleefully making wolves out of sheep.",7/10
14500,The Bellmen,"Early in the film, we are told that the life of a bellman is all about doing a great job to earn big tips. Well, here's one: next time you want to produce a comedy, make sure it's funny before you let anyone see it.",1/4
14501,The Benefactor,"A wonderful showcase for the actors and little else, Franny was entertaining if not frustrating.",6/10
14502,The Berlin File,"Everything here, except the action scenes, [feels] sluggish and rote.",2/5
14503,The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,"This poignant tale has an irresistible, heart-warming energy and also boasts sharp dialogue, skilfully interwoven subplots and a treasure trove of British stars giving a masterclass in ensemble acting.",4/5
14504,The Best Man Holiday,"The sexism isn't quite as noxious as one might find in Tyler Perry's films, but that's as far as the compliments go when it comes to this overextended and deeply crude sermon.",0.5/4
14505,The Best of Enemies,This sturdy drama has the good sense to recognize that allyship is only valuable when it's hard.,B-
14506,The Best Of Me,"The most vexing, and detrimental aspect to this picture, is the laughable choice of casting for the younger Dawson Cole.",1/5
14507,The Best Offer,"Fine actors as Rush, Sturgess and Hoeks are, almost everything they say remains dead on the page.",2/5
14508,The Better Angels,"The Better Angels eschews any sort of narrative linearity (and occasionally, coherency) without entirely alienating its audience.",3/4
14509,The BFG,The BFG is big friendly giant of a film from a director who knows how to make films on that note and on that scale.,4/5
14510,The Big Bang,"A low-rent neo-noir propped up by descriptions of, rather than depictions of, sexual kink and an odd interest in quantum physics.",1/4
14511,The Big Boss (Tang shan da xiong),Bad Kung Fu movies are like bad porn - still watchable with fast-forwarding.,3/5
14512,The Big Day (Jour De Fete),"Tati's directorial debut is also one of his funniest. Like his other movies, it's best to keep your eyes wide open and look at tiny images in the corner of the screen. Tati isn't playing M. Hulot in this flick, but he'll still make alert viewers' sides ac",5/5
14513,The Big Feast (La Grande Bouffe),"Estranho e por vezes chocante, o filme  rico em simbolismos em sua anlise sobre as frustraes do homem moderno, retratando a degradao de seus personagens atravs da entrega total  realizao dos prazeres da carne (em sentidos literal e figurativo).",5/5
14514,The Big Fix,"""The Big Fix"" presents a compelling array of damning testimony from EPA officials, journalists, scientists and politicians as well as emotional scenes of distraught residents...",4/5
14515,The Big Hangover,The cast is so endearing that they do wonders with the silly premise.,B+
14516,The Big Kahuna,"Not exactly the most promising jumping-off point for an exciting, thought-provoking drama, but that's exactly what the film evolves into.",3/4
14517,The Big Lebowski,"Nearly everything in The Big Lebowski is a put-on, and all that leaves you with is the Coens' bizarrely over-deliberate, almost Teutonic form of rib nudging.",B-
14518,The Big Parade,"The Big Parade (1925) is director/producer King Vidor's most famous, precedent-setting war film from the silent era. It was the first realistic war drama and has served ever since as an archetypal model for all other war films.",A
14519,The Big Picture,I can't discount the sheer pleasure I got from its constant gear-shifting.,3.5/4
14520,The Big Short,McKay fails to transfer Lewis's source material into purely cinematic terms.,3/5
14521,The Big Sick,"It's all at once a movie about overcoming disease, a story about cultural assimilation, a movie about stand-up comedians, a coming of age tale, and a rom-com. On the surface it shouldn't work at all.",4/5
14522,The Big Squeeze,"[It has] a story that feels like a 1930s screwball comedy, but is set in the present day and, even more incredibly, doesn't seem to know it's a comedy. It plays its contrived story perfectly straight, as if events like this could happen.",1/4
14523,The Big Ugly,"The characters of The Big Ugly get some appreciated room to breathe, but ultimately, they're suffocated by an obvious and far less nuanced plot.",2.5/4
14524,The Big Wedding,"Lines such as, ""Who do you have to lynch for a Cosmo around here?"" pass for a version of humor that only a Mississippi slave owner in 1858 would likely find funny.",1/4
14525,The Big Year,"Well-made, well-acted and at times very touching, despite featuring characters generally behaving like obsessed weirdos",3/5
14526,The Bill Murray Stories: Life Lessons Learned from a Mythical Man,"While the structure of the film grows slightly tedious-the doc provides a fascinating look at celebrity, spontaneity and how technology often prevents us from being present.",4/5
14527,The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars & Motor Kings,"If you've seen Major League and The Bad News Bears at least five times apiece, this is a relatively forgotten little comedy that is definitely worth a look.",80/100
14528,The Birth of a Nation,"Essential as history and good, not great, as filmmaking.",3/4
14529,The Bishop's Wife,A decent little romantic comedy that doesn't possess enough vitality to live up to its accolades.,71/100
14530,The Bitter Buddha,"The Bitter Buddha strains a little too hard for dramatic heft, but it's nevertheless a compelling, sweet, funny valentine to a comic's comic and a true American original.",B
14531,The Black Cat,"Even for a Fulci film, this is pretty lame.",2/5
14532,The Black Godfather,"A seminal figure ""behind the scenes"" in African American entertainment and politics gets his due in this affectionate, foul-mouthed portrait.",3/4
14533,The Black Panthers: Vanguard Of The Revolution,"Alas, its ultra-conventional, this-then-that approach, peppered with the reminiscences of long-since mellowed talking heads, rarely feels suited to the messy politics and personal lives of Black Panther Party firebrands ...",2.5/4
14534,The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975,Perhaps the greatest irony of all is that such a tumultuous and thrilling time in American history can be so easily reduced to a staid classroom lecture.,2/4
14535,The Black Stallion Returns,The final race is botched by so many parallel story lines that we lose track of where the stallion stands in the race. And the movie is sometimes so overcome by its own beauty that it forgets to be about anything.,2.5/4
14536,The Black String,"Its premise isn't the strongest or most original, but [Frankie] Muniz's vanity-free performance in the lead role effortlessly carries this mostly entertaining film from beginning to end.",7/10
14537,The Blackcoat's Daughter (February),"Setting a bunch of people loose on the screen and telling them to mope until something supernatural emerges, then calling it a tone poem about loss, is no way to keep an audience entertained.",2/5
14538,The Blackout Experiments,A terribly ineffective nonfiction horror film.,1/5
14539,The Blech Effect,"Blech's is almost the only voice heard in the movie, and after a while, the bipolar fallen investor with a gambling problem is all too easy to tune out.",2/4
14540,The Bleeding Edge,The Bleeding Edge stands a good chance at enlightening more people who have been (or might be) hoodwinked.,B
14541,The Bleeding House,The film works its tired conceit with maximum patience and minimal inventiveness.,1.5/4
14542,The Bling Ring,"The young cast impress greatly at times and their delivery of some of the more amusing lines with a pout and a ""like totally"" help make The Bling Ring something of an enjoyable experience, despite it's flimsiness.",2/5
14543,The Blob,"...if a vote were taken for the silliest sci-fi horror movie ever made, the original 1958 version of ""The Blob"" would come out pretty high on the list.",5/10
14544,The Blob,"Modest, disposable remake of a less-than-classic original... but dammit, evil Jell-O is still so cool!",3/5
14545,The Boat,"[It's] a film that cleverly turns some of the film's elements, like water and the ship itself, into a ferocious monster that forces our protagonist to exhibit some quick thinking in order to survive his unbelievable experiences upon a sea-faring vehicle.",4/5
14546,The Body Remembers When the World Broke Open,A slow burn that packs a powerful emotional punch.,B+
14547,The Bodyguard,"The movie does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight.",3/4
14548,The Bodyguard (Kaavalan),A twist near the end sends this contrived movie into a maudlin stratosphere from which it doesn't recover.,2/5
14549,The Book of Eli,"'And God said 'let there be light between a man's head and his shoulders,' said Denzel, as he carved through one bad guy after another.",C
14550,The Book of Henry,The Book of Henry is an original story that breaks rules. It will undoubtedly rattle audiences as a result. I think that's great.,B
14551,The Book of Life,Jorge R. Gutierrez subsumes the film's darker themes in a relentlessly busy farrago of predictable kids'-movie tropes and annoying attempts at hipness.,2/4
14552,The Book Of Love,"Profound, this film is not.",1/5
14553,The Book Thief,"It celebrates love and life in one sequence and takes it all away in the next, only to come back around to give your heart yet another bruising, but it always does so with purpose, making the film a well-earned flood of emotion.",4/5
14554,The Bookshop,"In The Library there are, in fact, twists reminiscent of the style of Wes Anderson... and although they are effective and estimable resources, they point to the indefinite cinema style of the Catalan [director Isabel Coixet] [Full review in Spanish]",3/5
14555,The Borderlands,A convincing British found-footage horror that actually has some good performances and genuine scares.,4/5
14556,The Boss,"A hit-and-miss comedy, but McCarthy leads a game cast through several memorable moments.",2.5/4
14557,The Boss Baby,"The Boss Baby might pacify kids, but this dirty diaper of a movie is further proof that Hollywood animation is in need of a change.",C-
14558,The Bounce Back,"Confirmation that opposites do, in fact, attract, even shrinks dispensing diametrically-opposed dating advice!",3/4
14559,The Bouncer (Lukas),"The plotting and action beats are a bit of a hash, but Van Damme lends it aged nobility in the title role.",1.5/4
14560,The Bourne Legacy,"Although there isn't nearly as much action as the original three movies, it's doubtful anyone will leave Legacy not wanting to see more of Renner and Weisz in these roles.",8/10
14561,The Boxer,"Thanks largely to the richly insinuative acting of Day-Lewis and Watson, we're profoundly moved by the power of Maggie and Danny's intentions and desires, if not their actions.",3.5/5
14562,The Boxtrolls,The perfect grown-up kids' movie.,4/5
14563,The Boy,mind-numbing nonsense,1.5/5
14564,The Boy,The director tries to generate a pace that his dramatic efforts fail to match.,C-
14565,The Boy And The Beast (Bakemono No Ko),"For all its supernatural stylings, it's the natural connections that count.",3.5/5
14566,The Boy Next Door,"Isn't even approachable as junk food, failing to turn flatlining material into deliciously sinful escapism. And here I thought Cohen couldn't get any worse than 2012's ""Alex Cross."" I stand corrected.",F
14567,The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind,"Ejiofor's compassionate script, adapted from William's 2009 memoir, is finely attuned to the cold realities that confront its warm characters.",B-
14568,Jack and the Cuckoo-Clock Heart,"Beautiful and hallucinatory, the greatest animated romance since Tim Burton's masterpiece CORPSE BRIDE. A revelation.",A
14569,The Boys and Girl from County Clare,"Agreeably soapy, but if you're not a Ceili fan, you're likely to doze off by the end of the first reel.",2/4
14570,The Brady Bunch Movie,"The problem with The Brady Bunch is that, satirical or serious, ninety minutes is too much.",2/4

14572,The Brand New Testament (Le tout nouveau testament),"With a sense of fun that is more playful than subversive, ""The Brand New Testament"" is a bouncy treat: not so much heresy as whimsy, with a smooth matte finish and a mischievous grin.",B+
14573,The Brass Teapot,...there does reach a point wherein Mosley's efforts at prolonging the running time results in elements of desperate nature...,2/4
14574,The Brave Little Toaster Goes to Mars,A definite spark of the subversive that by itself earns it a recommendation.,2.5/4
14575,The Breadwinner,The picture sings and inspires.,3.5/4
14576,The Breaker Upperers,"Madeleine Sami and Jackie van Beek are worth the price of admission, but The Breaker Upperers is a significantly flawed, inconsistent, creaky comedy.",3/5
14577,The Bridge (Die Brücke),"Wicki brings a tremendous sense of confidence to the project, letting the details of life on the home front heighten the tragedy to come.",4/5
14578,The Brink,"A watchable overview with few explosive details, but plenty of reasons to root for his downfall, and some modicum of payoff.",B
14579,The Broken Circle Breakdown,The Broken Circle Breakdown is the cinematic equivalent of a great album that gets played at a funeral. Ultimately it's a celebration; but the heartbreaking melancholy of love and life lost bleeds out of every note.,4/5
14580,The Bronze,A grueling experience to sit through if you're not in on the central joke and Rauch's character.,5.5/10
14581,The Brooklyn Banker,"Borrowing a few tricks from Martin Scorsese, the film isn't a slavish imitation but an engrossing and grounded drama.",2.5/4

14583,The Brother from Another Planet,Joe Morton gives a great silent performance.,5/5
14584,The Brothers Grimsby,Sacha Baron Cohen brings his B-game - or maybe even his C-game - to this moderate new comedy that basically defeated my attempts to like it.,2/5
14585,The Bubble,Eytan Fox renews the courage of Martin Sherman's landmark 1979 play Bent with his bittersweet new film.,3/4
14586,The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie,The first (and easily the best) of the Looney Tunes compilation flicks.,3/5
14587,The 'Burbs,A long shaggy dog story.,2/4
14588,"The Butcher, The Chef And The Swordsman","Wuershan's heavy hand, never letting up for a moment to allow any air or life to enter the film, cuts off the film's energy even as it rattles relentlessly on.",2/5
14589,The Bye Bye Man,"The Bye Bye Man could have been something other than another run-of-the-mill fable about smarty-pants teens who pooh-pooh an urban myth only to find out, slightly too late, that the legends are true.",2.5/5
14590,The Cabin in the Woods,"'Cabin In The Woods' is not just a great horror film, but also a thesis on why we need horror films and what role they serve in our diet.",A

14592,The Cage Fighter,"There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about ""The Cage Fighter,"" a competent work of non-fiction filmmaking that doesn't veer in any surprising directions, but it's an impressive consolidation of several cinematic traditions.",A-
14593,The Call,It damn well works. Until Halle Berry hangs up.,2/4
14594,The Call of Cthulhu,"The filmmakers themselves are generally paid not in dollars but in status among their fellow obsessives, which makes Call of Cthulhu truly a labor of love.",3/5
14595,The Calling,"[The cast's] ardent professionalism... helps tamp down the hysteria that might be expected to spring from the premise of a Catholic serial killer. Then again, this grisly murder party could have used some livening up.",2/5
14596,The Camden 28,"An amazing story. A genuine saga of life and death, friendship and betrayal, religion and war. The tale of ordinary people willing to risk their freedoms for their truths.",3/4

14617,The Catered Affair,Richard Brooks directed in a sort of free-wheeling way that carries the action jumpily from poignancy to farce and from moments of frowsy frustration to scenes of vulgar squawling en famille.,2/4
14618,The Celestine Prophecy,... indifferent direction douses whatever conviction gave the novel its ardent following.,D
14619,The Cell,"If digital design and stylized symbolism intrigue you, go to this unpleasant but meticulous mindtrip. But be aware that it's style over substance, amounting to less than meets the eye.",6/10

14621,The Challenge,Contemporary tropes of material luxury and ancient rituals coexist throughout Yuri Ancarani's documentary.,3/4
14622,The Chamber,"The Chamber is an undeniably tense watch with a subversive, gut-punch ending. While not plumbing any real genre depths, it should prove a solid and lucrative calling card for its clearly talented debut director.",3/5
14623,The Change-Up,Some good one-line zingers but relies too heavily on visual and vocal vulgarity.,B-
14624,The Changeover,... The Changeover offers the rare sight of a fantasy that feels both distinctly Kiwi and contemporary and that's something to be celebrated and cherished.,3.5/5
14625,The Chaperone,This hulk-with-a-heart-of-gold fable embraces banalities with a vigor matched only by its lack of imagination.,0.5/4

14628,The Cherry Orchard,[E]njoyable in the way long summer afternoons can be...,3.5/5
14629,The Chess Players (Shatranj Ke Khiladi),Its mannered goofiness echoes the pastoral comedy of Days and Nights In the Forest while the Raj-era dancing-girl trappings recall the decidedly grim The Music Room.,3/4
14630,The Child Remains,Creepy setting... promising premise... slow-and-obvious horror mystery.,1.5/4
14631,The Childhood of a Leader,"With his unusually accomplished directorial debut, Corbet delivers a strange and startling film that reflects the unique trajectory of his career, as well as the influence of the iconoclastic directors with whom he's already worked.",B+
14632,The Children Act,"[Emma] Thompson who carries the film, both literally - she's rarely off-screen - and emotionally; the burden of this particular case weighs down almost every line of dialogue, registers in almost every expression on her face.",2.5/4

14643,The Cleanse,"The film could have easily fallen flat, straying into B movie or comedy territory, but it's a masterful blend of horror, drama and comedy.",7/10
14644,The Client List,"Elects a soft route of melodrama, using pleasant actors to communicate desperation, refusing salacious details to play right to the target demographic of sympathetic mothers and wives.",B-
14645,The Climbers,"This account of the Chinese Mount Everest expeditions in 1960 and 1975 is a nationalistic spectacle that, curiously, often also allows personal sentiment to get in the way of the greater good.",2.5/5
14646,The Closer You Get,"It's a sweet film, mildly pleasant to watch, but it's not worth the trip or even a detour.",2/4
14647,The Clovehitch Killer,"Skiles' direction and Plummer's performance, + the focus on darkness permeating a small town suburbia, lends the film a My Friend Dahmer-esque vibe that will undoubtedly attract a sizeable following",3.5/5
14648,The Cobbler,"The last ten minutes of The Cobbler are a special kind of awful. The rest is a mere disappointment coming from McCarthy, but business as usual for Sandler.",4/10
14649,The Cold Lands,"The Cold Lands [...] sustains a lovely mood, but keeps the audience at a perpetual distance. It keeps threatening to turn into a movie, but never entirely does.",3/5
14650,The Cold Light of Day,"The only thing shabbier than the dull, near-incomprehensible night-time cinematography is the shopworn script.",1.5/5
14651,The Coldest Game,There are third act twists that atone for some of what's lacking in the first two.,2/4

14661,The Comedian,Hackford creates something between the slapstick daftness of Bad Grandpa and the existential darkness of Louie.,3/5
14662,The Comedy,"a challenging film that may ultimately be bulls***, [but] deserves tremendous respect for its clarity of vision.",B
14663,The Command (Kursk),"It's a heartbreaking, troubling film about men whose lives were cruelly deprioritised and whose families remain ever altered as a result.",4/5
14664,The Commune (Kollektivet),"Like some of the films of Vinterberg's Danish contemporary Susanne Bier, this looks like the basis for a commercial and easygoing Hollywood remake. But fluent and confident it certainly is.",3/5
14665,The Commuter,The Commuter forfeits a good movie about why an everyman might get ensnared in some lite Hitchcockian mishegoss for a mediocre one about how he might weasel his way out of it,C
14666,The Company You Keep,"Proving yet again that he just gets better with age, Robert Redford does a spectacular job in bringing this quasi-fictional tale of idealism run amok three decades later to the screen.",5/5
14667,The Competition,"The will-they-won't-they of the film is a non-starter, and as such the film's climax is stripped of suspense and even the most basic of dramatic payoffs.",1/4
14668,The Con Is On,The kind of movie that seems to think a heap of outrageous details equals a characterization.,1.5/4
14669,The Concert (Le concert),"An over-the-top screwball comedy with a thunderous, sentimental conclusion.",B+
14670,The Condemned,"Despite a lavish dose of gothic style (and the occasional inspired flourish, as when surveillance monitors are overcome with home movies of dead children), The Condemned's trek toward absolution is pretty familiar.",2/5
14671,The Confirmation,"Bob Nelson's screenwriting voice is unpretentious, approaching earnestly grounded characters with a deliberate lack of sentimentality.",B-
14672,The Conformist,"Storaro and Bertolucci have fashioned a visual masterpiece in The Conformist, with some of the best use of light and shadow ever in a motion picture.",3.5/4
14673,The Congress,"It hunts high and low for the human element in a virtual world. And yet for all its modish gestures, there is something endearingly retro about Folman's handling.",3/5
14674,The Conjuring,"[The Conjuring] will have the hair on your arms standing straight up, and your brain screaming in excitement!",4/5
14675,The Conjuring 2,"Those after a great, dark story will be impressed, seeing Wan once again deliver truly eerie scenes without the use of cheap tactics.",4/5
14676,The Connection,"A fascinating true-crime story gets a flat, formulaic treatment in The Connection. Where's the jolting, no-holds-barred energy of Popeye Doyle when you need it?",5/10
14677,The Conquest,"Duringer does not flinch from showing Sarkozy's flaws - the sudden bursts of temper, the taste for gold neck-chains, the wince-inducing table manners, and his overall air of coarseness.",3/5
14678,The Conspiracy,Why do so many contemporary filmmakers use the well-worn device of found footage and documentary shooting style to make thrillers? Does The Blair Witch Project have a mysterious power over all of them?,2/4
14679,The Conspirator,"This is by no means a great movie, but in telling a gripping and little-known true story with many contemporary resonances it has time(liness) on its side.",3/4
14680,The Corrupted,"Rather than a coherent conspiracy thriller, The Corrupted is several unrelated ideas jammed awkwardly together, and soaked in blood.",2/5
14681,The Cotton Club Encore,This is a gift to cinephiles everywhere from deep in the cellar and we're all lucky to get a sip.,5/5
14682,The Counselor,"Almost 100 percent vague, pseudo-profound dialogue and virtually no exposition or character development.",2/5
14683,The Counterfeiters,Only WWII junkies will find much of anything worth embracing here.,2/4
14684,The Courier,"In the moronic thriller The Courier, nothing works on any level, but most of all where it matters most-a script that makes sense.",0/4
14685,The Courtship of Eddie's Father,Enjoyable family comedy.,4/5
14686,The Crash (Jekyll Island),"The film may be too preposterous to take seriously, but at least writer-director Aram Rappaport trains his sights on the right enemies.",2/4
14687,The Crash Reel,"The Crash Reel is an atypical sports movie. It's about placing your ambition on the back burner, about winning through giving up.",4/5
14688,The Creeping Garden,It's something unique for both a genre exercise and a documentary: a science-fiction film that doesn't contain an ounce of fiction.,2.5/4
14689,The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course,"Chintzily made and amateurishly executed, but it will probably satisfy die-hard fans, simply because it allows Irwin to do precisely what they like.",C
14690,The Crow: Wicked Prayer,The Crow: Wicked Prayer is just like the first one -- if the first one had been made by a room full of mean-spirited six-year-olds with a finger-paint budget of $12.00.,2/5
14691,The Crowd Roars,Crosses the finish line as nothing more than routine.,C+
14692,The Crucifixion,"While Gens remains a cinematic visualist worth keeping tabs on, why he signed on to make a film this condescendingly dogmatic is a question I'll likely never know the answer to.",1.5/4
14693,The Cup,"It won't stop the nation, but it will while away a Saturday afternoon.",3/5
14694,The Cup,A delightful demonstration of how spirituality can coexist quite happily with an intense desire for France to defeat Brazil.,3/4
14695,The Cured,"Heartbreaking, compelling and terrifying, The Cured is a quick way to re-examine our capacity for forgiveness, tolerance and above all, fear",4/5
14696,The Current War: Director's Cut,"Gorgeous, witty, well-acted and old-fashioned period piece given its sparkling due in a new re-edit.",3/4
14697,The Curse of Buckout Road,[The Curse of Buckout Road] delivers an entertaining ride.,3.5/5
14698,The Curse of La Llorona,It's certainly not the weakest movie in this series but it also doesn't necessarily bring as much new to the table as might have been expected given the compelling folklore the film borrows from.,6.8/10
14699,The Curse of Sleeping Beauty,a fresh idea in a genre where too many ideas are overused and stale.,7/10
14700,The Curse Of The Gothic Symphony,"Extremely similar in theme, structure and tone to last year's Mrs. Carey's Concert, it suffers in comparison to that exquisite film, but it certainly stands alone as a swift, entertaining look at a very particular artistic quest.",3/5
14701,The Dalai Lama: Scientist,"In an age when it seems that the leaders of organized religion are often outright hostile to science, it's refreshing to see how wholeheartedly the Dalai Lama embraces scientific advancement and learning.",3/5
14702,The Damned,"The Damned does all it can to make witches scary once again, but flashes of inept acting and tonal fumbles spoil what could have been a horrifying feast of riches.",5/10
14703,The Damned: Don't You Wish That We Were Dead,"Its cast of characters is colorful (literally, in the case of Captain Sensible, known for his pink shag-rug jackets) and its access is impressive ('Our single biggest issue is people throwing pints onstage' the band's tour manager complains).",2.5/4
14704,The Danish Girl,"""The Danish Girl"" is so primly told, it treads so delicately around even the most conservative sensibilities that it might just work to change some minds, which makes it valuable in a way an edgier, swifter, more urgent, or exciting film might not be.",B-
14705,The Dare,The Dare's gory generational tale of torture terror is undercut by a jumbled narrative and largely uninspired and cliche-riddled characters.,5/10
14706,The Dark,"Faults aside, The Dark is still effective and emotionally charged. With enough kills to satisfy the bloodthirsty, it will certainly have an audience who love films about the undead but are craving something with a different taste.",3/5
14707,The Dark Horse,"Simply put, [Cliff] Curtis is phenomenal.",4/5
14708,The Dark Knight,The haunting and visionary Dark Knight soars on the wings of untamed imagination.,3.5/4
14709,The Dark Knight Rises,"Smartly-written, riveting and profoundly human with Oscar-caliber performances. It's the most emotionally and intellectually rewarding blockbuster in years, and thus far the best American film of 2012.",9.85/10
14710,The Dark Red,The Dark Red is a smart little film with a more sophisticated understanding of its subject matter and more to say than past stories of this sort might lead you to expect.,3.5/5
14711,The Dark Tapes,"Overall, this is considerably more successful in its thematic linkage than most of its ilk, and it' not hard to see why it has done well on the festival circuit.",3.5/5
14712,The Dark Tower,"So much is so wrong about this stunted film version of Stephen King's marvelously dense and dazzling series of eight novels, that all I can say is this unholy mess shouldn't happen to a King, much less a paying customer.",1/4
14713,The Darkest Hour,"The flailing, jittery film suggests extensive corporate meddling, and an overall lack of confidence in the enterprise.",D+
14714,The Darkest Minds,"Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson's live-action debut contains all the hallmarks of the kind of film that could have done brisk business five years ago, but now seems doomed to join other one-offs.",C+
14715,The Darkness,"""The Darkness"" is a mostly lame, decidedly tame supernatural horror movie starring actors far better than the project at hand. And, who the f*ck is Jenny?",1.5/4
14716,The Day He Arrives,...maintains a funny and sad focus on its single petulant subject.,B+
14717,The Day Shall Come,"Morris has less command over the edgy material, positioning his modern-day Keystone Cops in a series of smarmy vignettes that don't cut quite as deep. But it still delivers a scathing and often very funny indictment of homeland insecurities.",B
14718,The Day the Earth Caught Fire,The Day the Moviewatcher Nodded Off,2/5
14719,The Dead,"Huston was an old man when he died, but he had not withered dismally with age because he still had the courage and the imagination to attempt to make an impossible film of the greatest story that he had ever read.",3/4
14720,The Dead,The directors do a very fine job of keeping things creepy and consistently unsettling while trying to make their larger points.,4/5
14721,The Dead Center,"You may come out of The Dead Center rooting for a sequel. I'm just rooting for whatever Senese's next movie is, even (especially?) if it keeps me awake at nights.",4.5/5
14722,The Dead Don't Die,"Lazy does seem to be the right word when describing ""The Dead Don't Die,"" as it very occasionally feels like an unfinished work by Jarmusch",C
14723,The Dead Lands,"Expectations should be tempered, as the film defies easy categorization, and those expecting a simple action film may be disappointed. For those willing to take the journey, The Dead Lands proves to be a memorable, rewarding experience.",B-
14724,The Deal,"Ultimately, the movie fails to get the viewer into any sort of lather.",2/5
14725,The Death and Life of John F. Donovan,"In the film's best close-up, Newton's face sums up the experience of watching The Death And Life Of John. F. Donovan: confusion to annoyance to resignation.",1/5
14726,The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson,"[It's] is a celebration of a leader whose importance is finally being recognized through a wider lens. But it's also a rallying cry, a call for all of us to acknowledge, appreciate, and amplify the message of LGBT equality and liberation.",4/5
14727,The Death of Dick Long,The Death of Dick Long goes too far by taking the dramatic route instead of playing the revolting cause of Dick's death totally for laughs.,2/5
14728,The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,"The Death of Mr. Lazarescu comes on like a force of nature; radiating a startling intensity, it demands to be reckoned with.",3.5/4
14729,The Death of Stalin,"The Death Of Stalin is superbly cast, and acted with icy and ruthless force by an A-list lineup. There are no weak links. Each has a plum role; each squeezes every gorgeous horrible drop.",5/5
14730,The Death of Superman,What makes The Death of Superman outstanding is the focus on Superman's life as Clark Kent. The essential dichotomy to Superman's existence is skillfully explored.,3.5/5
14731,The Death of Superman / Reign of the Supermen Double Feature,"It feels like a comic book, It feels like its ripped off the page.",4.5/5
14732,The Debt (Oliver's Deal),A movie filled with great ideas. [Full review in Spanish],3/4
14733,The Debt Collector,A bloody-minded bore of a B-movie,1/4
14734,The Decent One,This biopic of one of the 20th century's worst mass murderers features archival film you may never have seen before.,A-
14735,The Decline (Jusqu'au déclin),"A lean, slow-starting survivalist tale that turns pulse-pounding for its final act.",2.5/4
14736,The Decline of Western Civilization,the documentary is quite enjoyable,3/5
14737,The Decoy Bride,"Predictable, plodding and paltry, Folkson's film looks cheap and like the mock wedding, nothing in it - especially the emotions - feels real, with the quality cast looking understandably disinterested.",1/5
14738,The Deep,"As a portrait of a lifestyle alien to many and the extraordinary resourcefulness of a very simple man, The Deep provides keen insight and empathy.",4/5
14739,The Deep Blue Sea,"The Deep Blue Sea remains flat as a duck pond, the prisoner of a story whose relevance, even in metaphor, has lost much of its sting, and whose dialogue has more than a whiff of a French and Saunders sketch...",2/5
14740,The Deer Hunter,"The actors in the principal roles are so convincing and the movement of this story, told on such a grand scale, is so compelling that its greatness is undeniable.",92/100
14741,The Delinquent Season,"If this film reminds us of anything, it's not to let go lightly.",4/5
14742,The Den,The Den is a pulse-pounding bit of techno horror that somehow makes the internet even more horrifying than it already is.,7/10
14743,The Departure,An intriguing manipulation of a woman by two male friends.,B
14744,The Descendants,"Mark your Oscar ballots: Beautifully written, splendidly acted, Alexander Payne's new serio comedy about love, forgiveness and redemption, adds another glorious panel to an already distinguished (if still brief) career.",A-
14745,The Descent 2,If you're a fan of the Crawlers and just want to watch some people get mangled up underground then you'll definitely find something to like here.,3/5
14746,The Details,"The nature of the genre gives The Details tonal issues that ultimately, it's able to overcome.",7/10
14747,The Devil and Daniel Webster,Wonderfully made fantasy that strangely leaves me cold.,4/5
14748,The Devil Bat,"You've got Lugosi giving it his all -- as if he believes he can hold this nonsense together by the sheer force of his will. And in some ways, he nearly does.",4/5
14749,The Devil Inside,"The Devil Inside is home to moments that will shock, scare, disturb, and leave you gasping. It's a trip to the dark side that's well worth taking.",3.5/5
14750,The Devil We Know,"[It] may not break any formal boundaries, but the shock factor makes it a must-see.",4/5
14751,The Devil Wears Prada,"This comedy for adults (no children, animals, or F/X) offers an inside, nasty look at the fashion world that's vastly entertaining, with the glitzy glamour and bitchy women fights that would make Cukor proud.",B+
14752,The Devil's Candy,"The needlessly complex and convoluted plot and the vague antagonist will make you scratch your head, not hide your eyes from fear.",2/5
14753,The Devil's Dolls,An often excessively tedious horror effort...,1/4
14754,The Devil's Doorway,"[S]pooky as hell, with some biting commentary on the history of the Catholic Church and a setting that grows increasingly claustrophobic and menacing as the narrative deepens.",8/10
14755,The Devil's Double,Could play on a double-bill alongside Hobo With A Shotgun about iron fist dictators with a pair of psychotic sons who shoot first and laugh just as quickly. You might have trouble deciphering which is supposed to be the ironic one though.,1/4
14756,The Devil's Miner,A gruesome look at child labor in the Bolivian silver,B
14757,The Devil's Playground,Never caught my interest.,B-
14758,The Devil's Rock,If Ken Russell remade The Bunker it might look like this.,3/5
14759,The Devil's Violinist,"Garrett, making his acting debut, isn't a strong enough presence to carry the nonmusical sequences.",2.5/4
14760,The Diabolical,"Half-decent effects, some seriously misguided mothering (by Ali Larter) and a third act twist don't add up to enough to bother with this one.",1/4
14761,The Diary Of A Teenage Girl,"At a time when Hollywood is often and rightly criticized for its negative portrayals of women, The Diary of a Teenage Girl sends a valuable message about the value of self-worth.",3.5/5
14762,The Dictator,"Bold, shameless and outrageously funny. You'll laugh your head off.",8/10
14763,The Dilemma,"The latest comedy to explore the ethics of male friendships, The Dilemma relies on the enthusiastic performances of its unique cast to see it through.",3/5
14764,The Dinner,"A shouty, hammy, tedious, damp-squib firework display of dullness.",1/5
14765,The Dinner Party,"Utter garbage, from conception to closing credits.",0/4
14766,The Dinosaur Project,"The found-footage hook is starting to feel pretty ancient, and the human drama is patchy at best, but Dinosaur Project is entertainingly silly.",3/5
14767,The Dirt,A delightfully disreputable biopic about some of rock's last true bad boys.,3/4
14768,The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them,"What makes The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby truly stand apart from all the other films of its kind...is the emotional depth that is allowed to be dug by the film's premise and length, executed almost perfectly",A-
14769,The Disappointments Room,Caruso's completely unremarkable attempt at a psychological-horror flick is a mixed bag of clichs and loose ends.,1.5/5
14770,The Disaster Artist,The Disaster Artist largely works because it brings us closer to Tommy while reveling in the same ingredients that have turned him into an icon.,B+
14771,The Discovery,Jason Segel and Rooney Mara have little onscreen romantic chemistry.,C
14772,The Dish & The Spoon,"With its deliberately quirky characters and meandering series of events, this mumblecore movie is enjoyably ramshackle, constantly catching us off guard with spiky humour or warm emotion.",2.5/5
14773,The Divergent Series: Allegiant,This series can't be over soon enough.,1/5
14774,The Divide,Gens' disaster pic has visual flair aplenty and an explosive third reel which mostly forgives the inoffensively routine first two.,3/5
14775,The Divine Fury,"With beautifully choreographed fight scenes intercut with gentle comedy and character-focused drama, this film takes viewers on a thrilling ride.",4/5
14776,The Divine Order (Die göttliche Ordnung),Feminism triumphs as Swiss women push for the right to vote.,B+
14777,The Diving Bell and the Butterfly,"Boasting a beautiful, surreal-like style, this biopic of Elle's paralyzed editor continues Schnabel's exploration of misfit artists, begun in Basquiat and continued in Before Night Falls.",A-
14778,The Do-Deca-Pentathlon,"In a time where movies continue to feel more and more disconnected and bleak, the film envelopes the viewer with its warmness -- a glowing optimism and sincere sense of humanity brought home with each punch zoom.",7.5/10
14779,The Dog,An unexpurgated blast of gay 1970s New York,2.5/4
14780,The Dog Lover,Clever but manipulative.,B+
14781,The Dogs of War,"Cry Havoc . . . and wake me up for the last 15 minutes. Not a bad film, but it is a bit of a mixed bag. I just wish that bag had held a higher body count.",3/5
14782,The Domestics,"For lovers of survivalist savagery, dark humor, practical mayhem and other genre goodies, The Domestics is bliss.",7.5/10
14783,The Doorman,Wayne Price's hilarious The Doorman is pure Fabio does Borat.,3/4
14784,The Double,An intellectual exercise lacking in tension.,C
14785,The Double,"...not only does The Double confirm Ayoade as one of the brightest rising talents behind the camera, it's completely his own and unlike anything you've seen in cinemas in quite some time.",A-
14786,The Dresser,It's easy to understand why an actor of a certain age would rush to sign on for The Dresser.,3/4
14787,The Dressmaker,"The film is a tonally uneven, genre-shifting hurricane of a thing, wildly careering off the rails and smashing into everything in its view.",2/5
14788,The Driller Killer,I suspect that a viewer might also begin wielding a power drill if he or she had to sit through it too many times.,3/10
14789,The Drop,"""Beyond the clunky inelegance of the plot, none of the actors are given much do that you haven't seen a hundred times before in far more inspired crime dramas.""",C-
14790,The Drowning,"Melodramatic, but moody and ""Victorious"" alum Avan Jogia is just menacing enough to make this thriller work",2.5/4
14791,The Duel,"The Duel wants to build to a feverish Heart of Darkness/Apocalypse Now climax, but has trouble determining how to get there.",2/5
14792,The Duelist (Duelyant),"...a swashbuckling, exciting tale.",14/20
14793,The DUFF,"The DUFF doesn't deviate much from the pattern, in fact it doesn't stray from it all, but a pair of playful lead performances by Mae Whitman and Robbie Amell makes it a worthy entry in the genre.",3/5
14794,The Duke Is Tops,Poor dialog punctuated with decent musical tunes.,2/5
14795,The Duke Of Burgundy,Never in all of cinema has the mashing of panties against a face been quite so fraught with genuine emotion.,4/5
14796,The Dyatlov Pass Incident (Devil's Pass),"The film is ridiculous and laugh-out-loud funny, though it's sometimes hard to tell if this is intentional or not. Either way, it remains riveting because of its effective tropes.",2/5
14797,The Eagle Huntress,"It's a fun story arc, and Aisholpan is a sweet protagonist who is easy to cheer for.",3/4
14798,The Earrings of Madame De... (Madame de...),"For the five-year period from 1950-55 (shortly before he died), Max Ophuls was arguably the world's greatest filmmaker creating La Ronde, Le Plaisir, Lola Montes, and this masterful study of a tragic, three-cornered romance.",5/5
14799,The East,"A refreshing concept, persuasive acting, and effective pacing make Brit Marling's latest, The East, one of the most captivating films of Sundance 2013.",9/10
14800,The Easy Life (Il sorpasso),"Yes, the frame is filled with the era's bikini-clad pulchritude, but the fuel here is primo neurosis.",5/5
14801,The Edge of Democracy,"[The] access is amazing, though a tighter edit would have helped.",3/5
14802,The Edge of Seventeen,"Pick a god, any god, and thank them for this movie.",A-
14803,The Editor,"The Editor starts off as a pitch-perfect Giallo spoof, but struggles to consistently maintain the same perverse entertainment factor until the film's bloody finale.",5/10
14804,The Edukators,"The film has a jaunty and intelligent wit, while the performances of the trio (Daniel Bruehl, Julia Jentsch and Stipe Erceg) are neatly nuanced and full of youthful bravado and swagger.",3/5
14805,The Efficiency Expert,"This is a minor comedy, in the style of Ealing films from the 1950s, of the little man against the bureaucrats.",C+
14806,The Eiger Sanction,"It has a plot so unlikely and confused that we can't believe it for much more than 15 seconds at a time, but its action sequences are so absorbing and its mountaintop photography so compelling that we don't care.",3/4
14807,The Elephant In The Living Room,"Hits the sweet spot of being entertaining, informative, and deeply moving.",4/4
14808,The Elephant Queen,The shots they get from the very small dung beetle to the giant savannas full of elephants are very impressive.,9/10

14811,The Emperor Jones,"Despite its marked deficiencies ... remains a ""must see"" for historic and cultural purposes",C-
14812,The Empty Hours,Aarón Fernández captures one of the most heartening elements of sex: that it doesn't always oblige our rules or expectations.,3/4
14813,The End,Not nearly as bad as its reputation. It's even pretty interesting.,3/5
14814,The End of Love,"Not sure if The End of Love's Mark Webber got that callback from Paul Thomas Anderson, but the Mark Webber who made The End of Love deserves to be getting a few.",3.5/4
14815,The End Of The Tour,"Quite touching and, at times, wise.",4/5
14816,The End Of Time,Funny how a film that explodes our conventional notions about time should be so up-to-date with the news.,3.5/4
14817,The Endless,"The Endless beats the drum for magnetic, riveting indies built on asking questions with the utmost curiosity (and hard genre thrills to boot).",9/10
14818,The English Surgeon,"Exceptionally well-crafted, this doc may appeal most to those who have a doctor in the family. But I can't imagine anyone seeing it dispassionately.",4/4
14819,The English Teacher,Rudderless in its presentation and outright stupid in its central conceits,2/10
14820,The Equalizer,One of the best american actions films in years. Rock-solid action with a heart. Washington is cast to perfection.,9/10
14821,The Escape,...a moving portrait of a woman who's seemingly been coming undone for a while.,3/4
14822,The Escape Artist,...the movie's pervasive lack of drama or tension results in a palpably flat atmosphere that proves disastrous...,2/4
14823,The Escape of Prisoner 614,"Like ""Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,"" without the evil, without charismatic stars, without a laugh in it.",1/4
14824,The Europeans,"I found myself hoping that several of the storylines, and the poor acting that accompanied them, would simply disappear.",61/100
14825,Evil Dead,"With simpler aims and oodles of blood, the new movie is a watered down scare-fest that works in spite of its formula by constantly frightening audiences into submission.",B-
14826,The Evil Within,"[It] will not be for everyone, and as the years pass it's likely that the story of its prolonged production and tortured creator will become better known than the film itself, but one thing you can say for sure ... Getty has left his mark upon the world.",7/10
14827,The Exception (The Kaiser's Last Kiss),"The sheer flair and application of the leading cast is enough to ensure this narrative is brought to life, and just about remains engaging throughout.",3/5
14828,The Expedition to the End of the World,"The cinematography is invariably stunning, featuring lovely scenes of wildlife and lichen-encrusted landscapes. That alone makes it worth going along for the ride.",2.5/4
14829,The Expendables,"One shouldn't knock the plotting for being distinctly old-school, but criticism deserves to be levelled at the manner in which so much talent is squandered.",2/5
14830,The Expendables 2,"While it's unquestionably great to see Arnie again toting a giant gun, The Expendables 2 fails to make the most of its game cast, and most surprisingly of all, is quite lacking in the action department.",2.5/5
14831,The Expendables 3,Both Stallone as creator/screenwriter and the filmmakers he brings on each time have learned how to tell a large ensemble story. All the fun stuff is still there but it's even stronger.,8.5/10

14833,The Eye of the Storm,"Lust, lies and envy laid bare in adaptation of Patrick White's novel.",4.5/5
14834,The Eyes of My Mother,"""The Eyes of My Mother"" is a must-see. It's intense as hell, and a supreme example of how the morally repugnant can be made to look weirdly beautiful.",B+
14835,The Face Of An Angel,There are lots of things to recommend about this film.,3/5
14836,The Face of Love,...an uncommonly adult romance that hits more than it misses...,3/4
14837,The Fall of the House of Usher,"Corman's adaptation was shot on a very low budget which shows in the overall quality of the production, but it benefits from strong cinematography and a tremendous, scene-stealing performance from the redoubtable Price.",4/5
14838,The Falling,This is terrific film-making - enough to bring a rush of blood to the head.,5/5
14839,The Family,"As bad as spending quality time with that annoying relative telling you how much better things were back in the day, but in the case of this movie they'd actually be right.",1/10
14840,The Family Fang,Ultimately Bateman's latest adds little to a debate leant pithier insight by Larkin 44 years ago.,2/5
14841,The Family Tree,It has a terrific cast of actors doing committed work; it also has a screenplay that tries so hard to be quirky that it tires itself out.,2/4
14842,The Fanatic,"It's easy to like, appreciate, and stand behind everything Fred Durst wants to say with The Fanatic. He's clearly taking our years of frustration... but there are creative decisions here that feel unnecessary and ugly",2/5
14843,The Fare,THE FARE is a beautifully crafted mystery that explores the desire for connection and intimacy within the confines of a moving taxing cab.,9/10
14844,The Farewell,"The result is a story that's both culturally specific and emotionally universal, as it gives a talented star a chance to shine.",3.5/4
14845,The Farewell Party,...opens with a genuinely hilarious opening that sets the stage for a wry yet heartfelt comedy/drama.,2.5/4
14846,The Farm: Life Inside Angola Prison,An eloquent documentary relating an inmate's point of view of being incarcerated in what very well might be the most dangerous and bloody prison in America.,B+
14847,The Fate of the Furious,"The Fate Of The Furious doesn't reach the heights of previous installments, but it is still an exhilarating joy ride, and proof that the franchise continues to be the most thrilling and astounding in cinema.",3.5/5
14848,The Fault In Our Stars,"While The Fault in Our Stars can be overbearingly schlocky at times, it is also an emotionally heartfelt film, especially in regards to the central romance that is sure to make the target audience swoon.",3/5
14849,The Favourite,"it's Colman who steals the show. She's ostensibly playing a gout-afflicted monster with capricious instincts and insatiable appetites...and she attacks this side of the role with gusto, shouting, yelping, whimpering and raging with Lear-like abandon.",4/5
14850,The Fearless Vampire Killers,redeemed by the movie's macabre silliness and folkloric atmosphere,3.5/5
14851,The Female Brain,A dry and entirely too clinical and gimmicky romantic comedy about the chemical and neurological differences between the sexes.,1.5/4
14852,The Field Guide to Evil,"Overly long, with only a few stories working coherently, but elicits a cosy, Tales from the Crypt fireplace feel.",5/10
14853,The Fields,"...no higher compliment could be paid ""The Fields"" than its constant recollection of the Spanish masterpiece ""Spirit of the Beehive""...",B
14854,The Fifth Estate,"I think there are a number of small strong moments in the film, but taken as a whole, it feels like a muddle.",C+
14855,The 5th Wave,"Unfortunately, the only outstanding thing the film's got is Chlo Moretz.",2/5
14856,The Fight,"Despite serving as an excellent primer for the type of work the ACLU performs, The Fight is more of a curiosity, preaching to the already converted.",B-
14857,The Fighter,"After watching someone who is so muddle-headed about what's good and bad for himself, admiration and a viewer's sense of involvement goes down for the count.",2.5/5
14858,The Final Girls,The Final Girls is the kind of film that could only be made by a true scholar of the form. It's just as funny as it is thoughtful.,A-
14859,The Final Master,"The film is a seemingly endless series of convoluted double-dealing, backstabbing, and factional realignment.",1.5/4
14860,The Final Member,"This project isn't intended to mock or titillate anybody, but to depict with sincerity and good humor the story of one man's quest.",8/10
14861,The Final Wish,"It's nothing fancy, but it does the premise far better than most of its predecessors.",3.5/5
14862,The Final Year,"... the movie just lets its subjects speak and trusts the audience to connect the dots. That's an effective and even illuminating approach, though it can make it hard not to watch the film through parted fingers.",3.5/5
14863,The Finest Hours,"While its first-act romance has a sweetly nostalgic, Andy Hardy glow, and its high-seas action sequences are mildly thrilling, The Finest Hours ultimately feels too harmless and predictable to fully surrender to.",C+
14864,The First Beautiful Thing (La prima cosa bella),"Italians need not worry - when it comes to issues with their parents, the Greeks still hold the title for being the most messed up. I mean, did you hear about what happened to that Oedipus kid?",3.5/5
14865,The First Grader,Made-for-TV mixes G- and R-rated stories,2/4
14866,The First Monday in May,Andrew Rossi pays sporadic lip service to recognizing cultural specificity before returning to his star-gazing ways.,1.5/4
14867,The First Purge,"But DeMonaco's signature hammy scriptwriting also rears its head. The characters are barely one-dimensional and prone to doing stupid stuff, like wandering out alone during a night of mayhem.",2/4
14868,The First Time,"The highest praise that I can give to this movie is that in the first fifteen minutes, I was rolling my eyes at these kids, and by the end, I was eager to re-watch that opening scene, to get to know them all over again.",A-
14869,The Fits,"""The Fits"" is unlike any dance film you'll ever see, which doesn't automatically make it good, just different. The film suffers from being diminutively compelling throughout, regardless of how deeply under your skin the score gets.",B-
14870,The Fitzgerald Family Christmas,"A terrific holiday movie. Edward Burns' most invigorating, heartfelt picture in years.",3/4
14871,The Five-Year Engagement,One of the more palatable relationship comedies due to the notable chemistry between Segel and Blunt and a supporting cast who are constantly stealing scenes.,7.5/10
14872,The Flat,A superbly edited doc about an unusual relationship between a Jewish woman and a German SS officer.,B+
14873,The Flaw,"Sington tackles the unenviable task of making economic theory digestible to Joe public by interspersing talking heads with punchy animations that illustrate without patronising, though the jargon quotient remains high.",4/5
14874,The Flight of the Intruder,"It's a strangely disconnected movie that leads up to a point, makes it, and then drones on for another 45 minutes in increasingly witless cliches.",2/4
14875,The Flintstones,"The first time around, The Flintstones' visuals are a light-hearted kick, but there's nothing more to do.",5/10
14876,The Flood,"The Flood is a powerful reminder that, underneath the headlines, millions of individual stories are waiting to be told, and millions of humans are simply fighting to survive.",3/5
14877,The Florida Project,"Things look grim for Halley and Moonee, but we can expect a lot from the people who brought their marvelous story to light.",5/5
14878,The Flower of My Secret (La Flor de mi Secreto),For the most part it is an absorbing story.,3/5
14879,The Flowers of War,"Zhang Yimou's film is a bit of a hodgepodge, a work that sets up as epic in scale, but then pitches its tale on a far smaller level.",2/4
14880,The Fluffer,The performances are more than serviceable and The Fluffer is well-paced and engaging until the flaccid climax.,2.5/4
14881,The Fluffy Movie,Iglesias makes his strongest impact when he sticks to material that is extremely personal.,3.5/5
14882,The Flying Deuces,"It's not bad, but it ought to be better with those stars and that director.",3/5
14883,The Flying Swords of Dragon Gate,A disappointing martial arts fable with Jet Li spinning and leaping to avoid the swords of powerful Eunuchs and nasty treasure hunters at the famous Dragon Gate Inn,2/5
14884,The Fog,Foggy? Yes. Scary? No.,1/5
14885,The Fog of War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara,The Fog of War is one of the most stylistically stunning of Morris's works,A-
14886,The Forbidden Dance,The movie feels like Dirty Dancing mixed with an 8-year-old's view of rain forest ecology.,1.5/5
14887,The Forbidden Room,"I've never taken LSD and wandered around a film archive, but I imagine the experience might be similar to The Forbidden Room.",4/5
14888,The Foreigner,"[Martin] Campbell's talent seems to be wasted on a movie that cannot seem to reconcile its hard, Rambo-ish violence with a convoluted conspiracy plot involving political and personal treachery in Belfast and London.",2.5/5
14889,The Forest,A series of banal jump scares and pale apparitions.,2/5
14890,The Forest for the Trees (Der Wald vor lauter Baumen),It's impossible not to emphasize with [the main character]...,2.5/4
14891,The Forest of Love,Hinges around an extremely ripe performance by Kippei Shiina as Joe Murata.,3/5
14892,The Forest of the Lost Souls (A Floresta das Almas Perdidas),"The film is strikingly well made, with vivid characters and a jagged sense of humour underscoring the sombre theme.",4/5
14893,The Forger,"Uninspired films utilizing cinematic devices that felt old decades ago are a regrettable part of the cinematic viewing experience, and ""The Forger"" squarely falls into this category. Even Travolta is better than this.",D
14894,The Forgiven,"Transitions back and forth from being a glorified play to a made-for-TV looking political drama, but well-meaning and educational",2/5
14895,The Forgiveness of Blood,Clash of cultures laid bare in Albanian-set drama.,3.5/5
14896,The Forgotten Kingdom,"Director Andrew Mudge's expansive film combines death, romance, poverty, mysticism, philosophy and friendship while holding steadfast to its realism; it sticks with you.",3/4
14897,The Forgotten Space,The filmmakers more or less show us in The Forgotten Space how the sea is capitalism's global trading floor writ large.,3/4
14898,The Founder,"Nicely shot, smartly acted and efficient in its telling.",4/5
14899,The Fountain,"The Fountain is beautiful, gripping and utterly transcendent. It's the best film of 2006.",9.8/10
14900,The Four Times (Le Quattro Volte),"There's certainly no shortage of contemplative static-camera films filling out the festival circuit, but at its worst, Frammartino's movie plays like a parody of this popular approach.",1.5/4
14901,The Fox & the Child,The term 'gentle' is too harsh a word to describe the pace of this tale which is so slow in places it's a wonder moss isn't growing on it.,2.5/5
14902,The FP,"The FP has a one-note joke of a conceit, and when that runs out, it has few actual jokes to fill the humorless void.",1.5/4
14903,The Free World,"The Free World works when dealing with the themes found within its title. When we have our freedoms taken away, how difficult is it to get them back. Is it wholly possible? Somewhere along the way, Lew decided such a story wasn't compelling enough.",C
14904,The Freebie,"An intimate, witty comedy-drama that evokes thoughts of 'The Seven Year Itch'",B
14905,The French Minister,"Tavernier's adaptation of the cult comic strip, Quai d'Orsay, is episodic, insular and hard work for non-Francophiles.",2/5
14906,The Freshman (College Days),Matriculates enough to earn a passing grade.,B-
14907,The Frighteners,The Frighteners is ... that rare horror film that actually gets better as it proceeds; this scare machine has a heart and a brain.,B+
14908,The Frisco Kid,"Funny, it's not. Sometimes stereotypically offensive, it is.",2/5
14909,The Front Line,South Korea's impressive entry for the 2011 foreign-language Oscar race offers a different kind of war picture in its foreshadowed setting of the blood-soaked front line between North and South Korea during the 1950-53 war.,B+
14910,The Front Runner,Jason Reitman chronicles this sprawling opera by taking a layered and ensemble-heavy page from legendary director Robert Altman.,B
14911,The Frontier,"Well-paced, nicely shot, and smart enough to give each member of the ensemble a few moments to shine.",4/5
14912,The Frontier,"Despite whatever rough edges it may have, the pieces come together to make a compelling whole.",B
14913,The Frozen Ground,"It's handsomely lensed, and when Cage and Cusack finally go nose-to- nose, the fur does fly.",3/5
14914,The Fruit Hunters,More of a buffet spread than a single plate. But every morsel is worth a taste.,2.5/4
14915,The Fundamentals of Caring,One of those emotionally artificial comedies that have become a staple of the Sundance Film Festival.,2/5
14916,The Funhouse,"Not as fun as it should be, but worth a visit.",7/10
14917,The Funhouse Massacre,I enjoyed The Funhouse Massacre and would watch it again; it's a good addition to the Halloween-themed canon. The title says it all: fun and massacre.,3.5/5
14918,The Furies,"Mann raises the bar for westerns, making them more adult and dramatic.",B
14919,The Furies,"While [Airlie] Dodds is a compelling presence, she can only inject so much energy into the convoluted mess.",2/5
14920,The Future,"The fearless creative energy [Miranda July] displays and her unflinching honesty about not just the outer but also the inner world of romantic despair, make The Future a unique and rewarding experience.",3.5/5
14921,The Future of Food,There's a stunning revelation in almost every scene.,A
14922,The Galapagos Affair: Satan Came To Eden,"The material and resources are certainly substantial, but the filmmakers clumsily weave separate stories together without detailing anything beyond a tangential relation.",2.5/4
14923,The Gallows,"A chilling setup gives way to insufferable characters, false scares and a bevy of ear-piercing jolts that shouldn't be confused with terror.",D+
14924,The Gallows Act II,"Lacks even the ""missed opportunity"" promise of the original, and even lesss frightening.",1/4
14925,The Gambler,"... screenwriter William Monahan, director Rupert Wyatt, and star Mark Wahlberg have made something that lives and dies on its own merits, in its own voice, worthy of its own conversation.",B+
14926,The Game Plan,"Mediocre but good-hearted, you can see ""The Game Plan"" coming for a long way off.",2.5/4
14927,The Gang's All Here,"The full flowering of Berkeley's particular genius -- and in incredibly saturated Technicolor, no less -- while being a lesser effort as concerns the nonmusical portions.",4.5/5
14928,"The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil","Writer-director Lee Won-tae uses telling details to quickly sketch out characters. But he also leaves key questions unanswered, which might be frustrating for some viewers.",3.5/5
14929,The Garden,Derek Jarman's 1990 film isn't without hope that we can regrow a paradise.,3.5/4
14930,The Garden Left Behind,"With a stunning performance from newcomer Carlie Guevara, The Garden Left Behind is transgender authenticity at its finest.",5/5
14931,Hemingway's Garden of Eden,"Shows young Hemingway as a prissy guy, not the macho guy we know, but the dialogue is not credible.",C+
14932,The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (Il Giardino dei Finzi-Contini),"It's an uneasy feeling to be inside an undefined space, especially if you may need to hide or run, and that's exactly the feeling De Sica gets.",4/4
14933,The Gardener,"Even those with no horticultural ability whatsoever -- okay, I'm talking about myself -- can enjoy The Gardener.",4/5
14934,The Gatekeeper,"Propaganda with its heart in the right place is still propaganda, and seldom easy to watch.",2.5/4
14935,The Gatekeepers,"Even when the so-called Gatekeepers offer up damning testimony against their organization, there's no real threat that they'll ever be held accountable for it.",2.5/4
14936,The Gentlemen,"It certainly won't be everyone's cup of tea, but for those who missed the old Guy Ritchie and his verbose, iconic gangsters, The Gentlemen will go down better than a pint and a pickled egg.",16.5/20
14937,The German Doctor,An ominous premise gains little traction by way of Puenzo's plodding approach.,D
14938,The Ghost and Mr. Chicken,Unusually good Knotts vehicle with atmosphere and a great creepy organ piece.,4/5
14939,The Ghost of Peter Sellers,"Many times throughout the documentary, Medak's friends and associated ask him why he's making this film. Like those tragic moments in our lives, we have to re-live it and confront it in order to move on with life.",8/10
14940,The Giant Behemoth,"Behemoth is, if not a great film, then a solid one, clever and smart in the right places.",3/5
14941,The Giant Mechanical Man,A romantic comedy whose quirkiness is complemented by italicized exposition.,1/5
14942,The Gift,Is there truly a villain in this story? Unlike most Hollywood productions it depends on your point of view and that makes the film something of an unexpected surprise.,B+
14943,The Girl,There are moving moments as Cornish channels the slow self-enlightenment necessary for Ashley's character arc. And the actress is particularly good in the scenes with the promising young Hernandez.,3/5
14944,The Girl from the Naked Eye,"There's a lot to like about the action film ""The Girl From the Naked Eye,"" especially some crisp martial arts fight sequences and the subtle sense of humor that surfaces now and then.",3/5
14945,The Girl in the Book,"The Girl in the Book is an auspicious debut for Cohn, a showcase for VanCamp's true acting abilities, and a fascinating feminine story.",B+
14946,The Girl In The Photographs,Little more than an extended exercise in style.,3/10
14947,The Girl in the Spider's Web,There's a slick competency on show. It's watchable enough but let down by a strange lack of interest in presenting Salander as anything but an engine to propel a plot.,3/5
14948,The Girl Is In Trouble,"It's a familiar plot, here played out on the streets of New York by a cast of rising stars with some impressive work already behind them. The Girl Is In Trouble may not have many new things to say, but it says them well.",3.5/5
14949,The Girl King,Its particular take on history makes it starkly relevant today; it is no mere escapist costume drama.,4.5/5
14950,The Girl on the Train,"When location scouting is the most striking aspect of a film, something's awry. And sadly this mystery fails to intrigue.",2/5
14951,The Girl,Hitchcock biopic reveals dark side of acclaimed director.,3/5
14952,The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest,full review at Movies for the Masses,1/5
14953,The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,"Young-adult in conception and execution, this award-winning animated romance with a Thanatos twist is an underdeveloped sci-fi Groundhog Day.",2/6
14954,The Girl With All the Gifts,"Without the narrative or formal conviction to pull off the clichés rampant throughout, it sadly seems stuck between two worlds.",C
14955,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,Hollywood's motivation for trying to cash in on a hot title is clear. It's not so easy to divine [David] Fincher's reasons for signing on.,3.5/5
14956,The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,"Satisfying mix of mystery, detection, psychosis, weird romance and social criticism.",5/5
14957,The Girls in the Band,"""The Girls in the Band"" is everything a worthwhile documentary should be, and then some: engaging, informative, thorough and brimming with delightful characters.",4/5
14958,The Giver,"Uniformity muddies The Giver's core message, and without a compelling story or central character it's not a film you'll want to receive.",2/5
14959,The Glass Bottom Boat,"The film flails airlessly, not unlike Day herself when she's mistakenly locked inside Taylor's anti-gravity prototype.",3/4
14960,The Glass Castle,The Glass Castle isn't an easy watch but is easily one of the best films of the year.,9/10
14961,The Glass Shield,"An implausible, wearisome clunker trying to ring true but making only dull thuds.",2/4
14962,The Gleaners and I,"[Varda] seems less the confident, brilliant filmmaker history would make her out to be and more of a doddering old biddy with too much time on her hands.",C-
14963,The Go-Getter,"How many road trip movies of self discovery starring artsy, skinny, white kids that fall in love with unconventionally cute little brown-haired girls do we need?",1.5/5
14964,The Go-Getters,"Determined as it is to offend, there's every reason to hate The Go-Getters and everybody in it. And yet, once you've absorbed their collective horribleness, the characters start to grow on you.",B-
14965,The Goebbels Experiment,The assemblage of archival footage reveals itself as a rivetingly experimental evocation of the Nazi rise to power.,2.5/4
14966,The Gold Rush,"A delight from beginning to end, boasting several of its maker's most memorable gags and Chaplinesque interludes.",5/5
14967,The Golden Dream (La Jaula De Oro),What the director has crafted here is charmless misery porn sorely in need of a personality transplant.,D+
14968,The Golem,"It looks like a particularly handsome illustrated volume of fairy tales--and acts like one, too.",3.5/4
14969,The Good Catholic,"It's a small film in every way, but I found it riveting.",3/4
14970,The Good Dinosaur,"A fantastic and frequently exhilarating feature that showcases Pixar's greatest strengths: technical brilliance, emotional texture, crossover appeal, and an impish sense of humor that takes the utmost advantage of the animated form.",90/100
14971,The Good Doctor,The Good Doctor isn't a ponderous bore because Blake isn't a strictly good or bad character: It sucks because he isn't even a compelling character.,1.5/4
14972,The Good Lie,"""The Good Lie"" is an emotionally dishonest account of a very real, common occurrence involving thousands of people who made their way to the United States in dire circumstances. Those refugees deserve better that this film, and so too do filmgoers.",D
14973,The Good Neighbor,"Screenwriters Mark Bianculli and Jeff Richard are too obsessed with driving their freshman thesis home, to the point that they fracture their own storytelling by overstuffing the narrative.",C-
14974,The Good Postman,"Hristov stands back and silently observes as the election campaign plays out, showing rather than telling, how much economic circumstances can drive both word and deed.",4.5/5
14975,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly",Morricone's soundtrack is one the most powerful in the history cinema and it alone is the reason why this film should be so highly appreciated.,10/10
14976,"The Good, the Bad, the Weird (Joheun-nom, Nabbeun-nom, Isanghan-nom)","Though Kim's western pastiche may be insubstantial, it's anything but a drag. It's masterfully directed, legitimately funny, and legitimately fun, thoroughly enjoyable even at an excessive 129 minutes.",B
14977,The Gospel of John,The heart of The Gospel of John ... is Mr. Cusick's performance.,B+
14978,The Grace Card,Such over-the-top emotional extravagance that even Cecil B. DeMille in his silent period might not have been able to get away with it.,2/5
14979,The Grace of Jake,"A sincere picture, with a lot of interesting, ambitious writing that these blips mostly punctuate.",7/10
14980,The Gracefield Incident,"Cheap and derivative, but not terrible.",1.5/4
14981,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"Over the years, Wes Anderson's movies have steadily developed a lush, eccentric world that operates on its own terms, and ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"" excels at exploring it.",A-
14982,The Grand Seduction,"Like many films that contrast the simplicity of a rural community against the confusion of city life, The Grand Seduction exhibits a patriarchal, xenophobic attitude.",1.5/4
14983,The Grandmaster,"The film, more likely to invite comparisons to the writings of Marcel Proust than the previous Ip Man films, is a gorgeous folly that never entirely emerges from its creator's head.",2.5/4
14984,The Great Alaskan Race,"It is certainly not a bad movie, but it is not particularly memorable either.",5/10
14985,The Great Beauty,"This movie looks and feels superb, it is pure couture cinema. But there is also a excess of richness and bombast and for all its sleekness I felt that the spark of emotion was being hidden, and there is a kind of frustration in the operatic sadness.",4/5
14986,The Great Buddha+,"With The Great Buddha +, Huang Hsin-yao makes a brilliant first impression on the international film scene.",8/10
14987,The Great Buster: A Celebration,Provides more than a CliffsNotes version on its subject.,B-

14989,The Great Flood,"Morrison and Frisell infuse the film with warmth and, where appropriate, a touch of wit, causing its subject to breathe anew.",4/5
14990,The Great Gatsby,"The Great Gatsby is ultimately an epic tragedy, a parable about America, the American dream ethos and its consequences, but the movie's overblown style chokes the life out of any substance the story may have.",C+
14991,The Great Gilly Hopkins,"A tough, simple story about a foster kid whose path to finding a family and a home is not an easy one. There are no platitudes here, just bittersweet truth.",3.5/5

14996,The Great Train Robbery,It all seems a bit dated now,C+

14998,The Great War,"Mostly recycled war movie cliches, with the props - guns, explosions, etc. - occasionally giving away the paltry budget.",1/4

15002,The Green Prince,"Suffice it to say, there has rarely been a work, documentary or no, that so thoroughly details both the inner machinations of the Hamas operations, or the interrogation and handling efforts of the hyper secretive Shin Bet.",B
15003,The Greening Of Whitney Brown,The Greening of Whitney Brown is content to be a typical piece of tween rural-versus-urban fluff from the old Hannah Montana: The Movie mold.,2/5

15005,The Grey Zone,I admired the film enough to someday soon give it a second chance...,3/4

15008,The Grinch,Animated Dr Seuss adaptation retains the magic of the original material.,4/5
15009,The Ground Truth,What sets The Ground Truth apart from standard network news coverage and even previous documentary efforts is the scope of footage Foulkrod has access to.,4/5

15011,The Grudge,Bland. [Full review in Spanish],2.5/5
15012,The Guard,It seems unlikely anyone but Brendan Gleeson could pull off a character like Sgt. Gerry Boyle and keep the crowd on his side.,7.5/10
15013,The Guardian,Screenwriter Ron L. Brinkerhoff deserves some credit for crafting a script that actually makes something interesting out of a pretty boring subject.,3/5

15015,The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society,"Utterly charming, as easy to fall in love with as the island is to Juliet.",4/5

15024,The Handmaiden (Ah-ga-ssi),"Deliriously fun, terminally silly.",B+
15025,The Hanging Garden,"If you can clue into Fitzgerald's blend of surreality and reality in not just the same film, but the same frame, then you'll be just fine.",3.5/5
15026,The Hangover Part II,Darker and meaner than the original but just as funny and horrifying.,4/5
15027,The Hangover Part III,"... while it may not recapture the exact same giddy thrill as the first film, this film manages to clarify what the overall story of the trilogy is in a way that I found satisfying and quite fitting.",B
15028,The Happy House,"""The Happy House"" is nothing if not a fresh mixture of colorful characters, questionable manners, and rusty, suddenly-new-again horror conventions.",2.5/4
15029,The Happy Poet,"The smiley ending, most likely meant to be ironic, feels tacked on. But the consistent comic tone of those earlier scenes--a gentle squirm--makes The Happy Poet a promising debut.",3/5
15030,The Happy Prince,"He's a strikingly tragic creature, but ""The Happy Prince"" struggles to say much more about that conundrum, leaving one to contemplate the potential had [Oscar] Wilde emerged from retirement to fill in the blanks.",C+
15031,The Happy Sad,Reducing complex relationship issues to a typical indie-flick blatherathon-complete with performances of varying quality and stilted dialogue-isn't helping anyone.,2/5
15032,The Happytime Murders,It sinks to depths far below even the most liberal and relaxed of expectations.,0.5/4
15033,The Harmonists,"If you're in the mood for good musical entertainment, but don't want to spend $100 at the theater, go see The Harmonists.",4/5
15034,The Harvest,"Excellent performances can't save The Harvest, which is riddled with too many plot holes.",5/10
15035,The Hate U Give,"The Hate U Give feels like the welcome crest of a new wave: not bland chronicles of sparkle-skinned vampires or dance-squad rivalries but real, often painfully relevant tales about race and justice and millennial identity.",A-
15036,The Hateful Eight,"The Hateful Eight's powder-keg first half ignites in a second half that's built on all of Tarantino's hallmarks, exploding in one fiery ball of tension, thrills and enigmatic storytelling with a snowy western twist.",8/10
15037,The Hatton Garden Job,It's comfortably one of the worst films of the year so far.,1/5
15038,The Haunting in Connecticut 2: Ghosts of Georgia,The filmmakers trot out slavery as a general sins-of-the-past signifier and then have no idea what to really do with such a painful real-world issue.,2/5
15039,The Unspoken,"It feels like Sheldon Wilson tossed a bunch of third-hand scares in a blender and set it to puree, resulting in a gray, flavorless sludge.",0.5/4
15040,The Haunting of Sharon Tate,"The Haunting of Sharon Tate plays more like a campy melodrama than a horror retelling of real events. The film isn't great, but the insanity is still quite enjoyable.",2/5
15041,The Hawks and the Sparrows (Uccellacci e uccellini),"A whimsical fantasy about Christianity and Marxism; the question is left open as to whether Pasolini believes in either, or neither. Not that it matters much, Pasolini seems to say.",3/4
15042,The Head Hunter,"Created by a skeleton crew on a meager budget with limited supplies, [The Head Hunter] is overflowing with imagination and atmosphere.",4/5
15043,The Healer,"A film stumbling again and again while marking the notes of comedy, fantasy and drama with sound clichs. [Full review in Spanish]",2.5/5
15044,The Heart Machine,It's got old-fashioned paranoia tones and an atmosphere of alienation in a way that suggests this might be what it'd look like if Antonioni directed a Nora Ephron script.,B+
15045,The Heartbreak Kid,"Lively and watchable, but never as funny or astute as it should be.",2.5/5
15046,The Heat,A script riddled with buddy cop clichés is saved by the fun dynamic between Bullock and McCarthy.,3/5
15047,The Hedgehog,"As oddball as the creature that inspired it, The Hedgehog warms the heart with its prickly tale.",3/5
15048,The Heir Apparent: Largo Winch,"German star Tomer Sisley brings a winning level of charm to Largo, rising to the physicality of the role and injecting humour, but never letting it slip into pastiche.",3/5
15049,The Help,"[VIDEO] This is an appropriately moving film that never bows to sentimentality. What you feel is real. By all means, see this wonderful movie.",A
15050,The Hero,"""The Hero"" is a resonant depiction of a man fearlessly reckoning with his life, his image and most importantly, his heart. Sam Elliott could not be more compelling.",B+
15051,The High Cost of Living,...a decidedly off-kilter premise that's utilized to pervasively agreeable effect by filmmaker Deborah Chow...,3/4
15052,The High Note,"Sure, Miss Diana's larger-than-life persona informs aspects of her daughter's riveting performance, but that doesn't account for the light touch, the self-deprecating humor, that the younger Ross brings to the table.",3.5/4
15053,The Highwaymen,The Highwaymen falls short of making the case that the good guys had the better tale.,B-
15054,The Hippopotamus,This adaptation of Stephen Fry's comic novel relies so heavily on voiceover that it's practically an audiobook.,2/5
15055,The Hitman's Bodyguard,"[The Hitman's Bodyguard] knows what it is, and lives in its ridiculous skin with an infectious, gleeful attitude.",6.5/10
15056,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"Vital as they are, Gollum and Bilbo can only do so much to keep us enchanted. Is Jackson able to sustain the magic in two more installments? I peer into Tolkien's Misty Mountains and embrace the journey.",B+
15057,The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,"It's a satisfying ending to the ""first"" visit to Middle Earth.",3.5/4
15058,The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug,"It's a breathlessly told, action-packed crowd-pleaser that restores the luster of the saga for those underwhelmed by its predecessor and leaves you excited for the final chapter in the trilogy.",8.5/10
15059,The Hole (Le Trou),This was Jacques Becker's last film; he died shortly after the film was released.,A
15060,The Hole in the Ground,"If your nerves can take it, here's your first great horror movie of 2019.",4/5
15061,The Holiday,There is bound to be a large appreciative audience for this chick flick. But it might not be you.,3/5
15062,The Holiday Calendar,"It's a more restrained, grounded movie than its predecessor - which, ultimately, means it loses some of the candy-coated glee that made A Christmas Prince such a buzzed-about so-bad-it's-good hit.",2/5
15063,The Hollars,Familiar elements are still made enjoyable by a winning ensemble led by Krasinski himself.,3/5
15064,The Hollow,A lethargic effort in desperate need of more judicious editing.,C-
15065,The Hollow Point,The Hollow Point is a blazing contemporary western that finds pleasure in punishment.,7/10
15066,The Homesman,There are some broad emotional flourishes and ripe performances in The Homesman - maybe bordering on the over-ripe. But it is put over with such richness and verve.,4/5
15067,The Honeymoon Phase,"A tightly written, beautifully acted, gripping psychological sci-fi thriller that will have you questioning just how well you know the person with whom you share your bed.",4/5
15068,The Horde (La Horde),The film starts promisingly and quickly detours into the kind of escalating gore and ridiculousness that always betrays a Hollywood resum piece.,2/5
15069,The Hornet's Nest,We're not suggesting that this film is going to drive A-list actors and directors out of the war-movie business. But The Hornet's Nest might push them to change what they do in the name of realism.,B
15070,The Horror of Frankenstein,"One of eight Frankenstein films produced by Hammer Films, The Horror of Frankenstein may not prove to be the worst of the lot, but it sure is one of the wackiest.",54/100
15071,The Horror of H.P. Lovecraft (LovecraCked! The Movie),A cameo appearance midway through by Troma guru Lloyd Kaufman can tell you exactly where LovecraCked's sensibilities lie.,C
15072,The Horror Show,I'm sorry if this reads more like a financial analysis than a movie review. You have to think of something during these movies.,1/4
15073,The Horseman,"Works as a basic, satisfying ""revenge thriller,"" in that it presents a simple story full of rage, retribution, and catharsis -- but it's so much better than that, really.",4.5/5
15074,The Host,"The special effects used to bring the creature to cinematic life are really quite excellent, and the frequent beastie bites should tickle even the most jaded horror freak.",4/5
15075,The Host,"Like everything else brand Stephenie Meyer, The Host is a mostly empty, dull and underwhelming genre re-hash. Here's praying that poor box office makes it the last of its kind.",2/5
15076,The Host,"Goes almost wholly wrong from that magic moment AFTER we wonder, ""Just what the Hell is going on here?""",1.5/4
15077,The Hot Flashes,"Could emerge as the sleeper hit of the summer. It is hilarious, heartfelt and, most significantly during a special-effects dominated season, human.",B+
15078,The Hours and Times,"Ever wondered what might have happened when John Lennon and his manager Brian Epstein spent four days together in Barcelona, just before the Beatles hit it big? Me neither.",2/5
15079,The House,"Nothing truly classic happening here in The House, but in a year that has been deathly for worthwhile comedies, this is an easy kill for a dependable number of laughs.",3/5
15080,The House I Live In,"Much of the information in the movie will be familiar to anyone with any passing knowledge of the subject, but Jarecki's comprehensiveness and passion sell this story, scoop or no.",B+
15081,The House of the Devil,"Yet another of this year's homage-facsimiles, The House of the Devil forgoes campy self-awareness in favor of reverential faithfulness--and in doing so, implicitly critiques contemporary horror cinema.",3/4
15082,The House of the Seven Gables,Nathaniel Hawthorne's classic tale about a cursed family.,B-
15083,The House of the Spirits,"Ultimately, The House of the Spirits blends enough melodrama and magic realism and personal conflict framed in political terms to keep virtually any audience happily absorbed.",3.5/5
15084,The House That Jack Built,"For those who feel this to be insufferable it's an understandable position. For others, this may be one of the more affecting and memorable films they're to see in some time.",B+
15085,The House with a Clock in Its Walls,"An engaging new direction for Eli Roth, who offsets the odd tonal hiccup with plenty of ghoulish delights.",3/5
15086,The Housemaid,An unnecessary remake of Kim Ki-young's 1960 Korean masterpiece.,2/4
15087,The Housemaid (Cô Hâu Gái),"For the same effect, try watching the fire channel, while listening to The Exorcist soundtrack and spraying water in your face.",5/10
15088,The Houses October Built,"IF the filmmakers had made a documentary about haunted houses, I might have liked ""The Houses October Built."" Instead, they opted for a knockoff of ""The Blair Witch Project."" What a mistake.",C-
15089,The Houses October Built 2,It's a shame to see the filmmakers betray the first movie in a way that renders this follow-up hard to believe and not very scary.,C+
15090,The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence),Six's flick is an over-the-top and in-your-face splatterfest that spends an hour and half making one bold statement: Centipede 2 isn't real life; it's just a movie.,3.5/5
15091,The Human Centipede III (Final Sequence),"No one should be forced to endure such garbage-not Six's actors or his crew and certainly not moviegoers (or even critics, for that matter).",1/10
15092,The Human Comedy,"Considerable talent in direction and acting, and if viewers are able to put their cynicism behind them, it is an enjoyable film.",3/5
15093,The Human Experiment,"A bit of judicious editing, cutting out the more dubious arguments in the film, would have made the remaining part look stronger.",3/5
15094,The Human Race,"Utterly generic, but reasonably well-played and directed",1.5/4
15095,The Human Resources Manager,"As helmed by Eran Riklis, Israel's Oscar entry is a sharply observed serio comedy, in which a self-centered careerist is humanized by embarking on a journey that's both physical and allegorical.",B+
15096,The Human Scale,"Like many movies looking at the effects of globalization on the human condition, Dalsgaard looks at the ways today's cities are destroying our quality of life.",3.5/5
15097,Human Tornado,The most essential Dolomite movie - make sure to see the unedited version.,4/5
15098,The Humanity Bureau,"The addition of Cage is one way to wake up the effort, but his attention to character can only take the picture so far before it runs out of ideas and money to bring them to life.",D+
15099,The Humbling,"Such inept, shuffling nonsense that an apter title might have been The Bumbling.",2/5
15100,The Hummingbird Project,The Hummingbird Project rolls along entirely on its leads' awkward rapport. Eisenberg filters most of the story's stress through his usual fast-talking hustler thing...while Skarsgård takes the more broadly comic role as a fussy genius.,3/5
15101,The Hunchback of Notre Dame II,Idiotic and ugly.,1.5/5
15102,The Hundred-Foot Journey,"An immigrant tale of immense heart, salivating visuals and charming performances.",3.5/5
15103,The Hunger,The Hunger left me craving for a more filling movie.,C
15104,The Hunger Games,"Despite its well-worn ideas and themes, Gary Ross's provocative, pulse-surgingly tense adaptation couldn't feel fresher, or timelier.",5/5
15105,The Hunger Games: Catching Fire,"Those who understand the outrage that powers the books should ... appreciate the blunt way it embraces Collins' cautionary vision of how a ruthless, privileged few can keep the masses down by dividing them and entertaining them ...",B+
15106,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Finds its success in meaningful themes, character-driven story, and smart execution, and ultimately creates some impressive depth for the phenomenon franchise.",4/5
15107,The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2,An emotional gut-punch of a film that's a fitting send-off for one of modern-day cinema's great heroines.,4/5
15108,The Hungry Ghosts,"Thirty-six hours. Multiple characters. Interlocking narratives. Michael Imperioli's Manhattan-set film-directing debut hits plenty of familiar notes, almost all of them off-key.",1/5
15109,The Hunt,"The Hunt may have been too see-through for me to truly enjoy it, but Vinterberg has crafted a very good movie here.",7.5/10
15110,The Hunt (Jagten),"The Hunt is a ""problem picture"" in which the problem feels neither urgent nor especially new.",C+
15111,The Hunt,"No one walks away without a target on their back, and that makes 'The Hunt' the riot it is. It's like the malicious kid on an elevator who pushes all the buttons.",3.5/5
15112,The Hunter,...a perfectly watchable piece of work...,2.5/4
15113,The Hunter's Prayer,"Solid genre thriller, even though it covers far too familiar ground",2/4
15114,The Hunting Ground,"While the film volleys disturbing statistics throughout, The Hunting Ground keeps the focus exactly where it should be: on the survivors.",B
15115,The Hunting of the President,An eye-opening and occasionally chilling look at the lengths to which some will go to destroy someone they perceive as a threat to their way of life.,3.5/5
15116,The Hunting Party,The film's failure can be attributed primarily to the unreasonably slow pace and surfeit of ridiculous plot twists...,2/4
15117,The Huntsman: Winter's War,"It is the follow-up that nobody much wanted to the film that nobody much liked, resulting in something even more visually elaborate and boring, and about which the number of tosses that can be reasonably given is lower than ever.",1/5
15118,The Hurricane Heist,This one's just blowing through theaters on its way to streaming services.,2/5
15119,The Hurt Locker,...uncommonly taut and uniformly well acted...,3/4
15120,The Hustle,"Congratulations, you played yourself.",2.5/5
15121,The Ice Cream Truck,"Despite the titular killer, this is very much [Deanna Russo's] movie... The Ice Cream Truck delivers more than just two scoops of lunacy covered in psychotic nuts and sprinkles. Chill out, and eat it up!",3.5/5
15122,The Iceman,"Watchable and well-crafted though this film is, you have to wonder if Vroman's next one is going to be about the lavatorial needs of bears or the religious convictions of the pope.",3/5
15123,The Identical,"The film's so preoccupied with being ""inspirational"" that it disastrously fails to evoke the allure of rock n' roll, particularly in America in the 1950s, when it represented an erosion of racial and sexual barriers.",0/4
15124,The Ides of March,"This 1970s-like political thriller and morality tale, which shows Clooney in top form as director, co-writer and actor, is a frontrunner in this year's Oscars; Ryan Gosling is brilliant.",A-
15125,The Illusionist (L'illusionniste),"French animator Sylvain Chomet's The Illusionist is a gushing love letter to Edinburgh, its unique geography, architecture and distinctively pale, wintry light.",4/5
15126,The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"With clumsy dialogue, poor plotting and some downright terrible performances, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a huge disappointment for any fan of Terry Gilliam's work.",2/5
15127,The Imitation Game,"As these pieces fall into place, Turing becomes ever more sympathetic while still feeling beyond anyone's ability to help or even understand.",B-
15128,The Immigrant,"...Gray is a filmmaker we love, and all the best qualities of his intelligent style are here in abundance...The Immigrant is contained, restrained, thoughtful filmmaking that satisfies on nearly every level...",B+
15129,The Immortalists,"Some voices of reason and skepticism do make an appearance to rebut and deflate Bill and Aubrey's monumental claims, but aren't allowed to fully elaborate on their arguments.",1/4
15130,The Impossible,Not since Jaws has the sound of ocean water heard on a movie screen been so terrifying.,3.5/4
15131,The Imposter,"Layton controls the information so tightly that he's able to spring a few surprises on the audience, including one towards the end designed to get us to understand how easy it is to buy into a well-told story, even when there's no evidence to support it.",B+
15132,The In-Laws,"A tima qumica entre Arkin e Falk, ressaltada pelo hilrio roteiro de Bergman e a direo inspirada de Hiller, faz com que esta comdia seja simplesmente imperdvel.",4/5
15133,The Inbetweeners,Affection for the characters will bring fans in. But many will leave wishing the makers of one of the most enjoyable programmes of recent years had left well enough alone.,2/5
15134,The Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"Not particularly funny or clever, it often hits the lows of some of the worst Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell character comedies.",5/10
15135,The Incredible Hulk,A light and airy popcorn movie full of all those watermarks Hulk fans clamor after.,3/5
15136,The Incredible Jessica James,"While Strouse does occasionally wade into treacly rom-com territory, Williams and O'Dowd's emotionally raw performances always keep the film grounded where it belongs.",3.5/5
15137,The Incredible Mr. Limpet,"Suitable only for the very, very young and the massively -- massively -- medicated.",2.5/5
15138,The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls in Love,"Warm-hearted, funny, and involving.",3/4
15139,The Indian Runner,"Penn is trying to get at gritty American ''truths'' about love, brutality, and blood ties. Somehow, though, it's all a bit pat: By now, even these stark themes have the ring of movie conventions.",B-
15140,The Inevitable Defeat of Mister & Pete,The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete features arguably the greatest performances from child actors so far this century.,4/5
15141,The Infidel,"In playing it safe, Baddiel has gutted the dramatic potential from his own premise and the result is a strangely meaningless, poorly plotted comedy that never generates big laughs.",2/5
15142,The Infiltrator,"The movie rises thanks to an ace in the hole: Bryan Cranston, whose stirring star turn hooks us completely.",3.5/5
15143,The Infiltrators,It's nevertheless fascinating to watch the detailed nature of this scheme as the modes come together.,B
15144,The Influence (La influencia),"With few exceptions, the post-REC Spanish horror film continues to stumble. [Full review in Spanish]",1.5/5
15145,The Inhabitants,"You have to credit the Rasmussen Brothers for going spectral rather than splatter, but a good disembowelment rarely hurts.",2/4
15146,The Innkeepers,"The Innkeepers an enjoyable enough experience to counterweigh the fact that it is ultimately a fruitless, disappointing venture from a story perspective.",B
15147,The Innocent (L'innocente),"Coming after the dissolute wackiness of Ludwig and the cavorting valedictory of Conversation Piece, Luchino Visconti's swan song L'Innocente is something of a genteel and stately affair.",3/4
15148,The Institute,"The Institute seems constantly on the verge of dipping into spoof, though of what exactly is difficult to say.",1/4
15149,The Insult (L'insulte),"The film can't be faulted for its attempt to argue for some kind of humane kinship and reconciliation, even if this attempt ends up dissolving the enmity in a sentimentality that, given what has come before, strains credibility.",3/5
15150,The Intended,"The basic concept of people trapped in a sweaty hell, looking for the money to get anywhere but there could have been borrowed from Wages of Fear, but sadly The Intended shares none of that film's excitement.",4/10
15151,The Intern,"Has progressive lessons that are caked in a broad, populist and not to say un-entertaining blob that runs a little too long, is a little too soft around the edges and features at least one major misstep.",3/5
15152,The Internet's Own Boy: The Story of Aaron Swartz,"Knappenberger's film is a heavy watch, mostly using talking heads and footage of Swartz before his death to to tell a story which comes to question the state of civil liberties in the US.",3/5
15153,The Internship,"Released during an especially lacklustre year in American comedy, The Internship breaks the trend by actually being funny. Not in any way a ground breaker, but better than most.",3/5
15154,The Interrupters,An enlightening look at a method used in Chicago to head off violence before it starts.,B+
15155,The Intervention,[Sundance 2016] DuVall's inaugural directorial effort is one she should be proud of.,2.5/4
15156,The Interview,"The Interview fails to live up to the hype, floundering as a rowdy comedy as it grows duller by the minute.",2/4
15157,The Intouchables,A true crowdpleaser that rises above its simple premise to deliver one of the most joyous and memorable film experiences of the year.,9/10
15158,The Intruder,There is a faintly greenish fuzz of bread mold at the edges of every frame of this stale exercise in psychological horror.,0.5/4
15159,The Intruders,"The Intruders stacks the deck with all the familiar horror signposts, as if straying from clichés were the most frightening thing of all.",1/5
15160,The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley,The film is at its best when it examines how Elizabeth Holmes conned so many prominent people rather than the figure of Holmes herself.,B
15161,The Invisible Man,"Alive with fresh thinking from Whanell and a dynamite Elisabeth Moss, this socially conscious horrorshow tips the old monster mash into way scarier shit about toxic masculinity that's as timely as #MeToo and Harvey Weinstein in handcuffs.",4/5
15162,The Invisible War,So powerful it's apt to change minds,3.5/5
15163,The Invisible Woman,"Ralph Fiennes has rarely been better than he is as the 19th century's most celebrated novelist, with his chops on screen just about matched by what he's done behind.",B-
15164,The Invitation,Karyn Kusama's overdue return is a serious slowburn walking a carefully constructed line between suspicion and paranoia that mesmerizes through its frenzied conclusion.,B+
15165,The Iran Job,"""The Iran Job"" is one of those documentaries that is sad and hopeful in equal measure and exceptional in its storytelling.",4/5
15166,The Irishman,"After a while, you adjust, or rather, you get tired of probing the slightly-off evidence of your eyes and the headache it produces. There's a lot of fun to distract you.",4/5
15167,The Iron Ladies,"While the result may be shamelessly short on sophistication, it's still effortlessly entertaining.",3/5
15168,The Iron Lady,"A breezy, whistle-stop tour through the unstable nitroglycerin of Thatcher's life and times.",3/5
15169,The Iron Ministry,"By the end, the real focus of The Iron Ministry isn't the train but the world zipping past it.",B+
15170,The Island (Ostrov),The Island is an aimless and unconvincing parable masquerading as a Bergmanesque art film.,2/5
15171,The Island at the Top of the World,"Loved it as a kid, but I haven't seen it since.",3/5
15172,The Island President,"Nasheed may be a small fish in a big geopolitical pond, but his enterprise and optimism are a welcome complement to eco doc doom and gloom.",4/5
15173,The Isle,"The film is beautifully shot...as beautiful as a foggy isle gets. The costumes and sets feel real for the period and the environment, which is remarkable for low-budget filmmakers to pull off.",3.5/5
15174,The Ivory Game,"A committed, valuable film.",4/5
15175,The Jack in the Box,"The monster design is good and some of the action scenes are set up well, with a bit more money and some faster pacing, The Jack In the Box could of really given us something exciting, although it never quite gets there.",5/10
15176,The Jaundiced Eye,A compelling documentary about a miscarriage of justice.,4/5
15177,The Jeffrey Dahmer Files,"...a consistently uneven documentary that could (and should) have been much, much better.",2.5/4
15178,The Jetsons,In the end the children have learned that capitalism is all about spoiling the ecosystem and exploiting workers. This sure makes them want to grow up to become entrepreneurs and build healthy businesses. Sad.,1.5/4
15179,The Jewish Cardinal,"Yes, it's another biopic, but Cohen's film tells an interesting story, in terms that are both engaging and surprising.",2.5/5
15180,The Jimmy Show,"Whaley's performance is earnest and often riveting, but he should have taken a few lessons from his peers at amateur night.",3/5
15181,The Journey,"The Journey is an apocryphal drama about the Northern Irish peace process, and makes its subject look like a methodical tootle around the block by comparison.",2/5
15182,The Judge,"Formulaic and too long, but still very entertaining. Tailor-made for Downey Jr.",7/10
15183,The Jungle Book,"A landmark effects film, maybe the most unnerving one since Forrest Gump erased the idea of archival footage being trustworthy",2.5/4
15184,The Jurassic Games,"There's a lot going on in The Jurassic Games and by and large, it's breezy highly watchable stuff.",7/10
15185,"The Karate Kid, Part III",This material is wearing out its welcome.,1.5/4
15186,The Keeper of Lost Causes (Kvinden i buret),"The Keeper of Lost Causes had the format, the aesthetic, the supporting characters and the grizzly torture; unfortunately all orbiting a Thunderbird marionette.",3/5

15188,The Kid,"A charmless, predictable picture.",5/10
15189,The Kid,"There's gunplay aplenty, but nothing about ""The Kid"" sets it apart from the many Billy movies that have preceded it.",2/4
15190,The Kid Brother,"The first silent film I ever saw that made me actually stand up and cheer As a first introduction to silent film, I would pick The Kid Brother over the best of Chaplin or Keaton every time.",A
15191,The Kid Who Would Be King,"By liberating a new generation from the lore they were taught... ""The Kid Who Would Be King"" empowers its audience to make the world their own.",B
15192,The Kid with a Bike,What's never in doubt is the sharpness and concision of the storytelling. Not a shot seems unnecessary.,4/5
15193,The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq,"Droll, deadpan, and, ultimately, disarming, The Kidnapping of Michel Houellebecq has a singular charm, even if you have never heard of the titular, real-life author.",3/4
15194,The Kids Are Alright,Good Who documentary,4/5
15195,The Kids Grow Up,"Stands out as one of the best documentaries ever made about the important transition of leaving home, a tricky and complicated stretch of time for parents and their offspring.",4/5

15238,The Last Laugh (Der Letzte Mann),"The film would be famous just for its lack of titles, and for its lead performance by Emil Jannings, which is so effective that both Jannings and Murnau were offered Hollywood contracts and moved to America at the dawn of sound.",4/4

15243,The Last Mountain,"Last Mountain is one of many environmental documentaries that play festivals and arthouses year after year, and Haney sets it apart and makes it compelling by focusing on the people in the valley as much as the environmental issue.",4/5

15261,The Last Waltz,Leave your inhibitions in the daylight -- The Last Waltz will make you want to sing and dance.,4/4

15271,The League of Gentlemen,Entertaining heist film. Watch for a quick bit from Oliver Reed.,4/5

15379,The Meg,"The best way to watch The Meg is with a big box of popcorn and an ironic eye roll: it's clearly designed for distracted audiences, given that each key plot point is explained around four times.",2/5
15380,The Memory Thief,The deeply felt performances from [Mark] Webber and Jerry Adler overwhelm the film about a young man whose way of connecting to others is to mirror them.,2.5/4
15381,The Mercy,The Mercy is a powerful and compelling story told with care and compassion by a brilliant cast.,4/5
15382,The Messenger,"Everything in this film is beautifully, evocatively shot, and effectively scored by the birds themselves.",4/5
15383,The Messengers,May be worth watching simply for the sight of Dylan McDermott playing a downtrodden sunflower farmer who at one point -- so help me -- attempts to punch a crow in the face.,F
15384,The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected),It all ends with a series of speeches that are rambling but humorous and heartfelt - much like the movie itself.,3/5
15385,The Midnight Man,"[This] horror opus still manages to be a maddening waste of time, things building to an annoying and deeply unacceptable climax that's nothing short of terrible.",1.5/4
15386,The Midwife (Sage femme),"A flawed endeavour, certainly, which grows somewhat tedious in the middle stages, but remains engaging thanks to the lead performances from the talented Catherines.",3/5
15387,The Mighty Macs,"This tiny Catholic school for women dominated the sport at a turning point in history, and this plucky, old-fashioned sports drama sets the scene and tells the tale with a lot of heart and a dash of wit.",2.5/4
15388,The Mill and the Cross,"An investigation into Pieter Bruegel the Elder's painting ""The Way to Calvary,"" Majewski's film is a stunning piece of art in its own right.",5/5
15389,The Mind's Eye,"By the time the ludicrously entertaining final stretch rolls around, The Mind's Eye has definitively established itself as one of the most engaging Midnight Madness titles to come along in some time...",3.5/4
15390,The Miners' Hymns,"In contrast to the vast, impersonal sweep of the contemporary footage, the archival material, some of which dates back over 100 years, is eerily intimate.",3/4
15391,The Miracle Season,"Iowa produces more corn than any other state in the Union, and this year it will have to add 'The Miracle Season' to the crop count.",C-
15392,The Mirror,This is the sort of film that starts you off without a net and leaves you to find your own footing.,4/4
15393,The Miseducation of Cameron Post,"The wheels are always turning, but the performance is subtle. It is far and away the best thing [Chloe Grace Moretz has] done.",5/5
15394,The Missing Picture,"It contextualizes cinema not only as a form of magic (capable of transformative, elated power), but also of revolution.",3/4
15395,The Mole Agent,"""The Mole Agent"" may not look like a documentary, but it builds to a poetic finale enmeshed in emotional authenticity.",A
15396,The Moment,"The film is a hybrid of a Lifetime movie focused on a ""strong woman,"" a run-of-the-mill murder mystery, and a yogurt commercial from hell.",0/4
15397,The Monitor (Babycall),"Sletaune maintains a fraught, creepy atmosphere throughout, making excellent use of the claustrophobic interiors and sparse, crumbling neighbourhood surrounds.",3/5
15398,The Monkey King 2 (San Da Bai Gu Jing),Pou-Soi Cheang's sequel to his 2014 blockbuster proves an infinitely more engaging and impressive mounting of key elements from Wu Cheng'en's classic novel.,3.5/5
15399,The Monkey King 3,"Its action scenes are let down by the poor graphics and cringey acting. As for the romantic storyline, it is cliched and forced, and ends predictably.",1/5
15400,The Monster,"The upcoming ""A Monster Calls"" may have a higher pedigree, but the rougher and rawer ""The Monster"" mines similar emotional ground.",B
15401,The Monster Project,"Let me put your fears to rest before we go any further... YES, there are monsters in this movie, and HELL YES do you get to see them.",3/5
15402,The Monuments Men,They don't make 'em like that anymore!,6/10
15403,The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones,"Grown-ups might've seen these tropes too many times to be impressed, but for teenage girls, it's a full-on Tumblrgasm in the making.",3/5
15404,The Most Assassinated Woman in the World (La femme la plus assassinée du monde),"The true beauty of The Most Assassinated Woman In The World, however, is its arc. Rather than bequeathing dry instruction on performance history, the wraparound story uses era-specific storytelling techniques to ensure the audience is in on the secret.",8/10
15405,The Most Dangerous Year,"Better at personalizing the experiences and concerns of transgender kids and parents than at documenting the political fight over the ""bathroom bill"" craze.",2.5/4
15406,The Most Hated Woman In America,"Its desultory storytelling and seesaw of tonal shifts is frustrating in a way that so many poor biographical films tend to be. It's a pity, as O'Hair is a heck of a historical figure and Melissa Leo is, in many scenes, quite gripping.",2/5
15407,The Motel Life,"""The Motel Life"" doesn't so much end as it instead sits and takes a breath. Yet, it's hard to imagine any other conclusion that wouldn't have ruined it.",B
15408,The Moth Diaries,Bubbles of nascent arousal froth at the film's feminine surface.,4/5
15409,The Motive (El autor),A solid idea in search of a better movie...,2/4
15410,The Motorcycle Diaries,"It is a rare biopic that does not venerate its subject beyond all reason, and The Motorcycle Diaries is a rare film.",B+
15411,The Mountain Between Us,"It's unsophisticated and hugely familiar (hardened viewers will spot the plot developments a mile off) but there's an earnest, simple satisfaction to be had, buoyed by two engaging star leads.",3/5
15412,The Mule,Eastwood probably just knows that Earl's story is a great one and that he's just the man to tell it. He happens to be right on both counts.,B
15413,The Mummy,"Cruise runs and shouts his way through set pieces, while others mumble mythological explanations, and Ahmanet simply stands around showing off her hieroglyph tattoos.",1/5
15414,The Muppets,If you similarly find yourself fighting back tears of joy - even during a sequence in which chickens cluck along to a sanitised (muppetised?) version of Cee-Lo's F*ck You - know that you are far from alone. The Muppets makes superfans out of all of us.,4.5/5
15415,The Murder of Nicole Brown Simpson,A mendacious and tawdry piece of cut-price tripe that indulges in sub-slasher nastiness while flashing a false badge of progressiveness.,1
15416,The Music Never Stopped,"A good Sunday afternoon cable watch, but not much more than that.",6/10
15417,The Music of Silence,"The Music of Silence is a fascinating story, given a by-the-numbers telling.",2.5/5
15418,The Music of Strangers: Yo-Yo Ma and the Silk Road Ensemble,It resonates as a portrait of artists trying to figure out their own paths toward making valuable contributions to the world.,2.5/4
15419,The Mustang,"'The Mustang' is not the ""prison movie,"" although it may not seem that way from the trailers and previews.",4/5
15420,The Naked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult,"Some of this is funny, but an awful lot falls flat, and the film ultimately wears out its welcome long before it's over.",2/4
15421,The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,"It's excruciatingly rotten in every sense: not funny, not comical, not entertaining, not even fun to look at.",0/4
15422,The Naked Island (Hadaka no shima),"Graceful goodbyes are said, then life moves on. The characters' urge for survival wins out, even if you're left shattered.",5/5
15423,The Naked Kiss,The studio offended Samuel Fuller by cutting his film against his wishes.,B-
15424,The Name of the Rose (Der Name der Rose),"There are so many good things in The Name of the Rose -- the performances, the reconstruction of the period, the over-all feeling of medieval times -- that if the story had been able to really involve us, there would have been quite a movie here.",2.5/4
15425,The Nameless (Los sin nombre),"I wound up admiring Balaguero's visual style, his imagery and cinematography, while remaining indifferent toward his characters, and hating his narrative.",4/10
15426,The Natural History of the Chicken,Lewis handles the documentary with a lightness of touch.,5/5
15427,The Neighbor,"This rough and raw thriller is reminiscent of the sort of pleasingly tawdry fare they used to show at drive-in cinemas and grindhouses back in the day, in a good way.",3/5
15428,The Neon Demon,"Silly, sly, sexy and sordid, The Neon Demon is a dark little burst of joy.",A-
15429,The Neverending Story,This fantasy tale drags incredibly despite its relatively short running time.,2/4
15430,The Neverending Story II: The Next Chapter,One of the poorest sequels ever.,2/5
15431,The New Girlfriend,"The concept of ""The New Girlfriend"" could have been played several different ways, from farce to high-drama to Hitchcock-ian thriller. Ozon decides to try it all, but in the end doesn't pull off any.",D+
15432,The New Radical,Fails to present its subjects' views with cogency.,2.5/4
15433,The New Romantic,"At its best, it's a sweet coming of age story with some keen observations to make about the way women's value is measured and female sexuality perceived.",3/5
15434,The Newspaperman: The Life and Times of Ben Bradlee,"A bit overly flattering, but a terrific portrait of a journalistic icon and great homework for this year's Oscar contending drama, ""The Post.""",3/4
15435,The Nice Guys,"There's little else quite like this fast-paced, deeply funny mystery - except Shane Black's other films",A-
15436,The Night Before,Derives the most laughs possible out of what is the simplest of holiday comedy concepts.,7.5/10
15437,The Night Clerk,The picture has some interesting intrigue although you can become annoyed with the repetitive way that the autistic title character relates to others.,B-
15438,The Night Comes For Us,Timo Tjahjanto masters fist-of-fury filmmaking not only by dragging audiences into a mega-fun knockout most pit but experimenting with body-cam angles and honoring continuity.,9/10
15439,The Night Eats the World (La nuit a dévoré le monde),"Even as the story drifts off, Night Eats the World derives its power from a beguiling, provocative implication: It's hard to confront a hostile world, but gathering the courage to do so doesn't make the job any easier.",B+
15440,The Night Listener,"By the time the credits rolled I was bored rather than stunned by the revelations within the movie and I just want these type of reversal/twist movies to get better, or go away.",2/5
15441,The Night of the Virgin (La noche del virgen),"The strongest scene is the first one, where Sebastin shows us what he can do as a filmmaker when not distracted by a commitment to going over the top.",2/5
15442,The Night Sitter,"The Night Sitter is a bright, energetic, smart genre exercise that never takes itself too seriously while making sure that all its bases are covered.",3/4
15443,The Night Visitor,The thing that makes The Night Visitor less than thrilling is its compulsion to give away its own plot.,2/4
15444,The Night Watchmen,"The Night Watchmen is a raucous riot that starts fast and never relents right up until its closing moments. It asks only your indulgence and delivers utterly, remaining a gory and hilarious ride every step of the way.",8/10
15445,The Night We Never Met,"Even if the movie frequently approximates a television sitcom, it never ceases to charm.",3/4
15446,The Nightingale (Ye Ying - Le promeneur d'oiseau),"Although competently crafted, the film lacks excitement of any sort.",2/5
15447,The Nightmare,Lacks any real insight into this phenomena or scares.,4/10
15448,The Nine Muses,"The Nine Muses could've been a bravura and rigorous display of erudition and editorial showmanship that's all structure and portent, but this film, which Akomfrah has said he's wanted to make for 20 years, has an obsessive power.",4/4
15449,The Nines,"This movie is metaphysical fun, and while some elements are predictable, it's an engaging mystery.",3.5/5
15450,The Normal Heart,"Directed by Ryan Murphy, it's bound to put Emmys in the hands of a remarkable cast that includes Mark Ruffalo, Julia Roberts, Alfred Molina, Jim Parsons and Matt Bomer.",4/4
15451,The November Man,"Featuring a star and brand of spy action that are both well past their prime, The November Man makes for a dull, regressive espionage thriller.",4/10
15452,The Number 23,"Jim barely gets by as a dramatic actor, as a crazy on the loose in a thriller he's more Looney Tunes than lunatic.",2.5/5
15453,The Numbers Station,Sits awkwardly between shoot 'em up and psychological thriller without offering the excitement of either.,1/4
15454,The Nun,"The Nun, which has proudly been calling itself 'the darkest chapter' in the series in the run-up to its release, winds up being the dullest instead.",2/5
15455,The Nun's Story,One of Audrey's finest dramatic moments,5/5
15456,The Nut Job,"With few laughs, barely tolerable characters and over-the-top action, THE NUT JOB clumsily makes the transition from short to feature film.",3/10

15458,The Nutcracker and the Four Realms,It's a mess.,1.5/4
15459,The Oath,[Barinholtz] manages to derive some amusing observations about toxic masculinity.,B-
15460,The Occupant (Hogar),Writing from the confinement of a global pandemic gives The Occupant a strange atmosphere of unease. [Full Review in Spanish],4/5
15461,The Odd Life of Timothy Green,An enchanting fairytale designed for young and old alike with a satisfying payoff for anyone willing to suspend disbelief in the face of a supernatural storyline with an implausible premise.,4/4
15462,The Odd Way Home,A film about what it means to truly go home and what it means to be family.,3/4
15463,The Odyssey (L'odyssée),"Of paramount importance is The Odyssey's ability to capture the wonders of the sea and evoke the feeling that entranced Jacques, which it achieves handsomely and convincingly.",3/5
15464,The Old Man & the Gun,Redford... has left movie lovers with one last gift that will put a smile to your face.,B+
15465,The One,"While the general public may not expect much from a Jet Li film, you might think a movie created by Glen Morgan and James Wong (X-Files and Final Destination) would be a little less lame.",5/10
15466,The One I Love,A tightly constructed and cleverly designed take on the modern love story.,8.8/10
15467,The Ones Below,"while the technical craft of it is fine, its influences are worn too proudly on its sleeve.",1.5/4
15468,The Only Real Game,"As well-intentioned, feel-good humanitarian acts go, ""The Only Real Game"" hits one out of the park for fanatics of America's favorite pastime or good-hearted folk with a little extra scratch in search of a new pet project.",3/5
15469,The Oogieloves in The Big Balloon Adventure,"One of the characters proclaims this will be ""the greatest movie ever"", and you know it won't be. Even the 4-year old sitting behind me was dubious of that claim.",0/4
15470,The Open House,"Movies don't always have to spell everything out, but here it's far too vague and therefore fails to encourage any sort of emotional connection towards its characters or add intrigue.",2/5
15471,The Optimists,One of Peter Sellers' best performances.,4/5
15472,The Oranges,"It's the Sundance version of Blame It on Rio, which is to say direly lacking in scenery and nudity.",1/4
15473,The Order,"A severely muddled, lethargically paced religion-based thriller without any thrills or even vague signs of entertainment value.",1/4
15474,The Order of Myths,"Smartly edited, utterly engrossing, and as intelligent an examination of American race relations as I've seen.",4.5/5
15475,The Orphanage,The Orphanage is this year's Pan's Labyrinth. And that's the high praise indeed.,5/5
15476,The Osiris Child: Science Fiction Volume One,A stellar and ambitious sci-fi gem that just gives and gives. Top notch in every category.,B+
15477,The Other Dream Team,Draws on archival footage and firsthand accounts from both players and outside observers to reveal the complex interaction of politics and athletics that colored the Euro-on-Euro competition.,3/5
15478,The Other F Word,"A rock documentary that makes punk rockers very human, vulnerable and down to earth. Powerful emotions are on display.",B
15479,The Other Lamb,Performances are otherwise routinely strong despite a lack of material and character development.,2.5/5
15480,The Other Man: F.W. de Klerk and the End of Apartheid,"The material being offered has been edited, composed, and made sentimental with the rigor of a political ad campaign.",2/4
15481,The Other Side of Everything (Druga strana svega),What shines through in the film is Turajlić's awe of her mum and a question: what made Srbijanka (what makes anyone) stand up and fight?,3/5
15482,The Other Side of Heaven,Davis has filled out his cast with appealing fresh faces.,2.5/4
15483,The Other Side of the Door,"A solid haunting-possession movie with good character work and unusual local colour, this works in a few surprises, sufficient scares and a nicely barbed punchline.",3/5
15484,The Other Side of the Wind,"Messy and meandering, but always in that distinctive Wellesian way that proves his talent was unparalleled even when it fell apart.",B
15485,The Other Son,"The oft-used theme of babies switched at birth gets a solid, politicized treatment in this French-Israeli production.",B+
15486,The Other Woman,"In lesser, more obvious hands, it could have become a drippy, manipulative Lifetime movie. Even if there are times when it does threaten to seem like such, writer-director Don Roos and his adroit cast never let it cross over.",3/4
15487,The Other Woman,The Other Woman is frustratingly indecisive.,2/5
15488,The Ottoman Lieutenant,This poor man's Lawrence of Arabia is a swashbuckling World War One tale involving a Muslim man's love for a Christian woman amid a background of people determined to kill each other.,B
15489,The Out-of-Towners,"The Out-of-Towners jogs doggedly on the treadmill of comedy, working up a sweat but not getting much of anywhere.",1.5/4
15490,The Outcasts,"Before it was even over, I was already forgetting about it.",1.5/4
15491,The Outlaw,"Surprisingly, this minor, off-beat western didn't turn out that bad.",B+
15492,The Outpost,"A reasonably strong war film, probably the best feature film made to date about the war in Afghanistan (Living Life Fearless)",3/5
15493,The Outrageous Sophie Tucker,"portrait of an indomitable woman, punctuated with her songs and her monologues",6/10
15494,The Outsider,"as is frequently the case when the same person writes and directs, one talent is stronger than the other.",5/10
15495,The Outsider,"Can a gaijin ever be trusted like family, or will his motives ultimately be self-serving? It's an interesting question in a story that's otherwise completely devoid of interesting questions, but The Outsider is too enamored with its foreign star.",D
15496,The Outsider,"'The Outsider,' at a short 86 minutes, moves at a leisurely pace. It builds suspense and lets us get to know the main protagonists enough to get emotionally involved in their fates.",2.5/4
15497,The Overnight,"There's this weird, unshakeable feeling of nostalgia by the time the credits roll: the party's over, it's time to go home, but damn, what a night.",A
15498,The Overnighters,"The Overnighters is starkly bleak and devastatingly humane, and an indelible American documentary.",A-
15499,The Overture,"The film probably loses some of its effect when it is brought to a Western culture, but it is still captivating.",7/10
15500,The Owl and the Pussycat,...the film provides more wit than most of what passes for comedy today.,7/10
15501,The Owners,"The droll indie shocker squanders a ripe, zeitgeist-clutching premise.",2/4
15502,The Pack,"Despite the interesting openings the film punctures in its formula, the detours from the expected course of events are short and return us firmly to known genre territory.",5/10
15503,The Package,"Big laughs are found along the way, with the central grossness of the plot getting the movie to a level of playfulness that's not often found with this type of vulgar funny business.",B
15504,The Pact,"It's a promising, efficient debut for McCarthy, but any kind of originality isn't part of the deal.",3/5
15505,The Pact II,"The Pact II plays like a more convoluted version of The Pact - and since I don't care for Nicholas McCarthy's original, I think you can guess how I feel about Hallam and Horvath's sequel.",5/10
15506,The Painted Bird,I can state without hesitation that this is a monumental piece of work and one I'm deeply glad to have seen. I can also say that I hope to never cross its path again.,5/5
15507,The Painter and the Thief,"There's nothing pat or easy about The Painter and the Thief; itself a work of poetry and art, the film plays with the meaning of its own title at several points.",4/4
15508,The Pajama Game,"One of the better musicals of its era, and a fascinating fusion of two disparate genres.",3.5/4
15509,The Pale Door,"THE PALE DOOR is a decent addition to the difficult-to-tackle Horror Western subgenre, but gets weighed down by narrative and pacing issues.",5/10
15510,The Paperboy,"Narratively shapeless, Daniels follow-up to Precious is part murder mystery, part interracial melodrama, part siblings tale, part coming of age, and mostly star vehicle for Zac Efron in white underwear",C
15511,The Parking Lot Movie,What's missing from the film is a real feel-the quiet moments of daily conduct-for the parking lot itself and its inhabitants.,2/4
15512,The Parting Glass,O'Hare's writing is often excellent; it's a shame that his depiction of a tightly-wound family often feels closer to theatre than cinema.,3/5
15513,The Parts You Lose,"Bullying and abuse in bleak, wintry character study.",3/5
15514,The Party,"Unassuming and old-fashioned funny entertainment isn't exactly what we associate with this film-maker, but that's what she has very satisfyingly served up here.",4/5
15515,The Party's Over,An amazingly candid and insightful look at the contemporary American political process.,4/5
15516,The Passion of Anna (En Passion),"The Passion of Anna is one of Bergman's most beautiful films (it is his second in color), all tawny, wintry grays and browns, deep blacks, and dark greens, highlighted occasionally by splashes of red, sometimes blood.",5/5
15517,The Patience Stone,The only ferociousness comes from Farahani... She gives The Patience Stone its gravitas.,3/5
15518,The Patrol,This is an unsparing and occasionally bleak look at the frustrations of fighting an unwinnable war with inadequate gear.,3/5
15519,The Patsy,Fascinatingly made Lewis film. Too bad it's not very funny.,3/5
15520,The Pawnbroker,"One of the first Hollywood films to deal with the Holocaust, The Pawnbroker is thematically and stylistically innovative, borrowing some of its devices from the French New Wave, such as brief flashbacks, stylized b/w imagery, and jazzy score.",A-
15521,The Peanut Butter Falcon,"Logic is sometimes sacrificed in the name of friendship in The Peanut Butter Falcon, an American odyssey with a welcomed retro feel and a good heart where its lead duo can romp in cheery harmony.",7/10
15522,The Peanuts Movie,I am apparently allergic to 'Peanuts.',4/10
15523,The People I've Slept With,An alternately jaw-dropping and lighthearted look at 21st Century mating habits as apt to leave you in stitches as in shock over the ever-evolving state of the human relating.,4/4
15524,The People vs. George Lucas,"More concentrated on surface fears than penetrating hardened geek exteriors, failing to connect an clear argument worth the time invested. It's a bent valentine 11 years too late.",D
15525,The Perfect Age of Rock 'n' Roll,Scott Rosenbaum's pallid grunge-messiah music pic neither burns out nor fades away -- try sputtering like a cigarette butt in a bottle of warm Bud Light.,1/5
15526,The Perfect Date,Netflix's The Perfect Date is a fairly standard and entirely enjoyable rom-com that excels as a starring vehicle for the charming Noah Centineo.,3/5
15527,The Perfect Family,"The prevailing mood is that of a Hallmark Channel film, where plot and symbols are just too bright and obvious and squared away.",6/10
15528,The Perfect Guy,"The Perfect Guy escalates quite nicely, leading to a satisfyingly white-knuckled finale.",B-
15529,The Perfect Match,"Overall, this delightful ensemble dramedy is reminiscent of a couple of other great urban classics, Love Jones (1997) and The Best Man (1999). That's good company!",4/4
15530,The Perfect Weapon,Better than expected actioner that was supposed to launch Speakman into a big-time movie career; then Street Knight shot that notion down.,3/5
15531,The Perfection,"Shepard's feature violently plucks at your heartstrings and cements itself as a relevant, albeit brutal allegory for conversation topics revolving around trauma.",4/5
15532,The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"A whooping, leaping carnival of shouting about your difference in the faces of all those jocks and squares who never even heard of Sonic Youth.",2/5
15533,The Pervert's Guide To Ideology,The motormouthed Zizek serves up an intellectually provocative psychoanalytical dissection of Hollywood movies.,4/5
15534,The Petrified Forest,"Stagebound and very literary, but still good,",4/5
15535,The Phantom Carriage,Still is impressive technically.,A-
15536,The Phenom,"The Phenom, like its protagonist, is hard to pin down, making for a film that's transfixing and opaque in equal measure.",3/5
15537,The Photograph,"...quiet and pensive with an undertow of melancholic regret and a light topping of comic relief all set to Robert Glasper's elegant jazz score. Issa Rae and Lakeith Stanfield create a tentative romance, its unspoken emotions simmering into a full boil",B
15538,The Piano Tuner of Earthquakes,"It's a surreal experience, maddeningly incomprehensible and dull, but with an evocative beauty.",1.5/5
15539,The Pill,"Writer/director J. C. Khoury's debut feature, ""The Pill,"" is the model of independent efficiency. It's a dose worth taking.",7.5/10
15540,The Pillow Book,"I can't say that I've ever entertained fantasies of writing on someone's body. But Peter Greenaway's The Pillow Book does, at least, succeed in making it look like an erotic activity.",B-
15541,The Pinochet Case,"While Guzmn frustratingly refuses to give Pinochet's crimes a political context, his distance from the material is mostly admirable.",3/4
15542,The Pirate Fairy,"There are some gorgeous Disney touches, rabble-rousing songs on the pirate ship and the usual 'best friends for ever' message.",3/5
15543,The Pirates,"""Pirates"" is fun, though with a running time of more than two hours, it's overlong. And too many of its battle scenes are too dimly lit.",2.5/4
15544,The Pirates! Band of Misfits,It'll be worth a case of doubloons to anybody with little ones to entertain over the Easter hols.,3/5
15545,The Place Beyond The Pines,"There is true beauty in the despair that pervades ""The Place Beyond The Pines.""",B
15546,The Plague Dogs,The whole movie is shot through with despair and dread; it feels like a prolonged howl of helplessness.,5/5
15547,The Plagues of Breslau (Plagi Breslau),"Offering a set-piece every 10 minutes, a twist every 30, it's pure pulp, but Vega knows how to sell it, and there are pearls of wisdom amid the nastiness.",3/5
15548,The Platform (El Hoyo),"Gaztelu-Urrutia isn't asking the most profound questions here... but he is having an absolute blast doing so, and along the way creating some of the more disgustingly outrageous scenes in recent memory.",3.5/4

15550,The Pleasures Of Being Out Of Step,Remarkably fluid and never lass than compellingly watchable.,3/4

15552,The Polka King,"The truth in his story may be stranger than fiction, but 'The Polka King' is largely unconcerned about what that truth means beyond funny music and shady deals.",2/5
15553,The Pollinators,"Although it may lack substance, on an educational level, The Pollinators is almost essential. [Full review in spanish]",3/5
15554,The Pool,"One of the weirdest, most original entries in this year's dramatic competition--American indie set in Goe with Hindu actors--The Pool should divide film critics, but a closer look beneath the surface reveals consistent themes in Smith's growing oeuvre",B-

15561,The Power Of Few,The film's tightly scripted hours in New Orleans wield their way to a destination that's worth the time spent getting there.,2.5/4
15562,The Predator,"There are sparks of Shane Black's humor and style lining up with the brutality and bite of the 1987 original, but they are few and far between because the end product feels misguided, and like it's been sliced and diced to the point of semi-incoherence.",5.5/10
15563,The Preppie Connection,Toby is so un-self-aware that his journey seems like mere obtuseness; what the film has to say about youthful degeneracy is less than zero.,1.5/4

15568,The Price of Desire,"Sometimes borderline risible, but even so, one can't but fail to be impressed it got made at all, given the subject is really mostly of interest to design geeks and those fascinated by intellectual property law.",2/5

15594,The Queen of Versailles,"While in some ways the collapsing of the Siegels' wealth may seem like commeuppance for their excessiveness, Greenfield has painted such a human portrait that Jackie, in particular, remains sympathetic, even when she is adding to her own tragedy.",4.5/5

15623,The Rental,Dave Franco delivers a decent directorial debut with The Rental... I just wish it induced more shudders than apathetic nods.,6.5/10
15624,The Rescuers,Let it be said up front that a lesser Disney effort is certainly miles above most animated films.,3/4
15625,The Rest of Us,"I believe that people behaving well can be every bit as dramatic as people behaving badly. Here's a movie that proves me right, softly.",3/4
15626,The Resurrection of Gavin Stone,"The faith-promoting comedy-drama The Resurrection of Gavin Stone is pretty lifeless as a comedy, but earns back some charm as an earnest drama.",2/4
15627,The Retrieval,"Less old-fashioned than demure and pass, evoking the visual style and rhythms of a 1990s made-for-TV movie rather than a daring, revisionist independent feature.",2/4

15632,The Returned,"Manuel Carballo's film proves that the zombie narrative is still capable of subversion, but does so with the laziest, Lifetime-grade intimations of social relevance.",1.5/4
15633,The Revenant,The Revenant is flat-out fantastic horror-comedy that is safely mentioned in the same breath as masterpieces such as Re-Animator.,9/10

15636,The Revival,"The look, achieved by John Wakayama Carey to reflect a simple beauty of the surroundings, is the finishing flourish of a film that delivers a punch nobody will see coming.",87/100
15637,The Rewrite,An entertaining comedy with a nicely delivered message about second chances.,3/5
15638,The Rhythm Section,Even the twists seem painfully ordinary.,2/4
15639,The Rider,"Zhao's combination of the visual palette of Malick, the social backbone of Reichardt, and the spontaneity of Cassavetes creates cinema verit in the American plains.",B+
15640,The Right Kind of Wrong,Pretty locales and an even prettier Ryan Kwanten don't make up for this painfully silly romcom that's more wrong than right.,3/10
15641,The Riot Act,"Great period detail, an intriguing but unsurprising story flatly scripted and acted.",1.5/4
15642,The Riot Club (Posh),"Apart from the performances, there is nothing much to latch onto in ""The Riot Club."" The bitter sense of humor entertains, but overstays its welcome halfway through.",C-
15643,The Rise (Wasteland),"At heart a heist movie, snappy and dry in its humor, clever in its elaborate robbery scheme, and somewhat bloated and unspooled in its storytelling.",2/4
15644,The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,"Ultimately, the film proves that Bitcoin is at the very least more appealing than succumbing to any of its critics' fears.",7.5/10
15645,The Rite,The Rite commits the supreme sin of making the devil dull.,D
15646,The Ritual,"Directed by David Bruckner, the film's horror is engaging; its look, handsome. While thoughtfully done, the entertainment value of this sombre scare fiesta isn't high.",2.5/4

15648,The Road,"For a spell, the film gets by on its unpretentious flair for atmosphere, even its disconcerting nonsensicality.",2/4
15649,The Road to Fame,"...a film that is often interesting, in a multi-culti sort of way, but also contains a lot of loose ends that make it frustrating to watch.",6/10
15650,The Road to Wellville,"Off-putting at first, this self-consciously scatological comedy does grow on one.",4/5
15651,The Road Within,"The film's tired sentimentality aside, its general lack of empathy is most damning.",1/4
15652,The Robber,"The story is about increasing isolation, and as it progresses it's like watching someone engaged in survival training -- anything extraneous has to go, like emotion, for example, or human interaction.",3/5

15654,The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again,"The film may have some minor flaws, but you will easily overlook them because if you don't, Laverne Cox is going to set you, well, not ""straight,"" in this case.",4/4
15655,The Roommate,"Apparently the filmmakers didn't realize pretty faces, blood and alcohol don't automatically make a good horror movie. Well, at least they got a decent soundtrack out of it.",1/5

15658,The Ruins,Letting it get under your skin doesn't sound so bad once it gets inside your head.,2.5/4
15659,The Rules of the Game (La règle du jeu),"Even with its immediate contemporary relevance softened, this film alone is enough to seal his reputation, as its playful love games, satirical bite and technical marvels refuse to diminish.",5/5
15660,The Runaways,"Music video director Floria Sigismondi's The Runaways is far from a perfect movie, but there are moments when it comes about as close to catching the visceral kick of the pre-iPod rock experience as any film I've ever seen.",3/5
15661,The Rundown,"not high art, not by a longshot, but it's way big fun",4/5
15662,The Runner,"As attractively shot and as well-cast as it is, the gloomy, inert The Runner isn't a film that sprints or dashes. It merely chugs along steadily.",2/5
15663,The Russian Woodpecker,"""The Russian Woodpecker"" is the story of two countries that may have divided but who are still linked through their politics, exports and the ghosts that still wander the contaminated grounds of both Chernobyl... and the Russian Woodpecker.",A

15676,The School of Flesh,I cannot imagine a Hollywood movie like this.,3/4
15677,The Science of Sleep,"Like Eternal Sunshine and Gilliam's Brazil, it demands to be seen more than once and is impossible to sum up in one review.",4/4

15685,The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,Fans of the original movie may be more forgiving of the weak storytelling and the awkward performances that make up this lackluster sequel.,5/10
15686,The Second Mother (Que Horas Ela Volta?),"While Anya Muylaert's engaging drama doesn't shy away from the realities of life as a home help in Brazil, she also concentrates on the upbeat humanity of those involved and suggests that change may be coming with the next generation.",4/5

15690,The Secret Life of Pets 2,"It's full of zest, wit and charm even if its storyline is a bit of a dog's dinner.",3/5

15730,The Skin I Live In,"Almodóvar's story-telling is nowhere near as shrill as it once was: as a mature artist, he has refined his skills to a point where these soap-opera tropes assimilate smoothly into a complex whole.",4/5

15736,The Snowman,"[The Snowman is] entangled, tense and ominous like the snowy winter landscapes in which it passes, but in its resolution hides a twist that flirts dangerously with manipulation. [Full Review in Spanish]",3/5
15737,The Snowtown Murders,"Snowtown mines similar territory to Rowan Woods' seminal The Boys, in its exploration of very bad deeds born of pressure cooker family dysfunction and machismo.",3.5/5
15738,The Son (El hijo),"An uncomfortable, but terrifying film. [Full Review in Spanish]",3.5/5
15739,The Son of No One,"Almost a great film, SON OF NO ONE is ruined by some truly boneheaded editorial tricks during the conclusion.",6/10
15740,The Sonata,"The Sonata never quite achieves the fluency towards which it strives, but few films of this kind do, and for those who love this subgenre it is nevertheless a pleasure.",4/5
15741,The Song,"Press materials for The Song describe it as ""the sexiest faith-based movie ever."" While that's technically true, it's also an incredibly low bar to clear. The film is completely generic and doggedly formulaic.",2/4
15742,The Song of Names,"[François] Girard proves once again that he's a master of music. By weaving both original compositions and classic works flawlessly into the film, The Song of Names becomes a solemn reflection on war and a lost brotherhood.",3.5/5
15743,The Song of Sway Lake,"The film's absurdly strong performances, music, and aesthetics all bring to life a wonderful film you won't want to miss. Do yourselves a favor, and buy a ticket when it comes your way.",9/10
15744,The Sons Of Tennessee Williams,"The talking-head testimonials succeed one another so quickly that it becomes difficult to track individual personalities, a structural problem that works to dissolve unique stories...",2.5/5
15745,The Soul Collector,"Atmospheric and unsettling, 8 utilizes moody visuals and excellent sound design to deliver a satisfying folk-horror story that, while inconsistent, is worth a look.",6.5/10
15746,The Sound Of Music Live!,"The downside was a certain flatness to the sound mix, a disconnect between the voices and the orchestra and an emptiness that caused the few jokes the script provided to land with a thud.",2/4
15747,The Sound of Silence,"The characters are compelling, but I would like to have known more about how Peter came to this place in his life...",7/10

15750,The Souvenir,"In tackling a story that is presumably, and perhaps painfully, close to home, [Hogg] has made her farthest-reaching film yet.",5/5
15751,The Space Between Us,"Call it The Unspectacular Now...We're supposed to applaud as these crazy kids flout authority and escape across the country, but since the movie has so easily squandered its intriguing premise, there's little reason to cheer.",2/5

15753,The Spectacular Now,The most important adult-oriented film about the victories and woes of high school life in the last decade.,A
15754,The Spirit,"The novelty of having many femmes in a genre that's largely male-driven, and the fact they are played by potentially appealing actresses as Mendes and Johansson, do not compensate for the narrative and technical shortcomings of Miller's solo debut.",C-

15759,The Square,"Though it falls ever so short of being tagged as great, this accomplished and genuinely gripping crime drama is worthy of your time, money and attention.",3.5/5
15760,The Square (Al Midan),"Easily one of the most complex, most nuanced, and frankly most important documentaries made about the ongoing political developments in Egypt. Heck, I'll go further, it's one of the finer historical documentaries I think that's ever been made, period.",A
15761,The Square,"The result is somewhat disappointing because Östlund's talent got buried by a pretentious accumulation of ""performances""[Full review in Spanish]",2.5/5
15762,The Squeeze,Bits of characters and scenes suggest a less cheesy or more breezy movie could have resulted from this.,1.5/4
15763,The Standoff at Sparrow Creek,"The dialogue crackles, the characters are well-defined, and the actors smartly cast - especially Dale, whose coiled, crafty vibe is ideally suited to the role of a former police interrogator.",3/5

15768,The Stolen,A western as inept as it is preposterous.,2/5
15769,The Stone Roses: Made of Stone,"What emerges is a film of missed opportunities, as if Meadows had a backstage pass but squandered it drinking in the beer tent.",3/5
15770,The Story Of Luke,"The outsized nature of their insensitivities is meant to reinforce the pain and humiliation from Luke's perspective, but it makes for a movie with an uneven tone.",C+
15771,The Story of Qiu Ju (Qiu Ju da guan si),"There is a point in the film when it begins to seem repetitive: The leader will remain unbending, the Qui Ju will keep appealing. Then we begin to connect with the underlying story of the film.",3.5/4
15772,The Story of the Last Chrysanthemums,"This is a decent movie, but I admit to being baffled by its inclusion in discussions of Mizoguchi's best work, let alone the greatest films of all-time.",2.5/4

15775,The Strange Ones,The journey there is compelling enough to make it worth the investment.,B+
15776,The Strangers,"As with last year's lean, mean B movie Vacancy, Bryan Bertino's The Strangers is a white-knuckle thriller in which a couple going through relationship difficulties is terrorized by psychos.",3/4
15777,The Strangers: Prey At Night,"The actions of the family in Prey at Night rarely acknowledge logic, and often seem to be deliberately mocking common sense.",1/4

15794,The Sweeney,It's a brainless joyride that ends up spinning its wheels in macho clichés.,1/5
15795,The Swerve,"It is an amazingly cathartic experience. I'm incredibly impressed that Dean Kapsalis was able to convey the suffering of a woman so well, without belittling or objectifying Holly in the process.",10/10
15796,The Swindle,"Huppert and Serrault's perfectly synched performances -- effortless, enviable and embarrassingly good -- get plenty of comic mileage from the shifting balances of power within their... relationship, but are impeded by a snail-paced script.",3/5
15797,The Switch,A formulaic rom-com with some sharp dialogue and a solid performance from a six-year-old.,B
15798,The Sword of Doom,A film defined by its meticulously precise construction.,3.5/4
15799,The Taking Of Deborah Logan,"If you're looking for a spooky little film that's free of pretension and sometimes logic and are into getting some quick shivers, you really cannot go wrong with The Taking of Deborah Logan",3/5
15800,The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,A great thriller set in the bowels of the New York City subway system. It's influence on contemporary films has yet to be fully appreciated.,5/5
15801,The Taking of Tiger Mountain,Its slow-going opening stretch and assorted mawkish subplots might just be the price a viewer has to pay for the sight of Yang and Hawk slugging it out in a biplane as it careens down a seemingly endless escape tunnel ...,B-
15802,The Tale of Zatoichi Continues (Zoku Zatôichi monogatari),"It's the mood, atmosphere, and attitude that make the Zatoichi movies so damn cool.",86/100
15803,The Tall Man,"A sly, strange and subtly engaging horror story that will no doubt leave several viewers angry, confused, or arguing on twitter.",4/5
15804,The Taste of Money,"As the sexual, financial and criminal shenanigans get ever more complicated, absurd and melodramatic, the film becomes increasingly tiresome; it's not even possible to enjoy its excesses in a 'so bad it's good' way.",1/5
15805,The Tax Collector,"All this movie has to say is that David Ayer enjoys creating misery, and sharing it. What a repugnant, hateful piece of work this is.",D-

15807,The Tender Trap,Would-be-hip look at a swinging single in NYC,2/5
15808,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,"Dark, savage, and nihilistic, this is the kind of ride that leaves you shaken and emotionally drained",4.5/5
15809,The Theatre Bizarre,"Absent anything scary or even shocking, the only question is why Enola sticks around for all six shorts. Or why the filmmakers think we would.",1/4
15810,The Theory of Everything,"Redmayne towers: this is an astonishing, genuinely visceral performance which bears comparison with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.",4/5

15812,The Thieves,Welcome to the K-cinema equivalent of comfort food.,4/5
15813,The Thin Man Goes Home,The Nick and Nora Charles crime formula story works even in the sticks.,B
15814,The Thing,"While it doesn't hold a flamethrower to the 1982 cult classic, The Thing prequel is itself a genuinely frightening and horrific monster movie.",3/5
15815,The Thing with Two Heads,"Within hours... the two-headed escapee is on a motorcycle and being chased by no less than 14 police cars. Every one of them is destroyed during the chase, a process that takes so long that seven, or even five, squad cars might have been enough.",1/4
15816,The Things We've Seen,"""The Things We've Seen,"" which had to have been made on a budget less than the craft services line item on an average Hollywood film, is an undeniable celebration of the independent spirit.",6/10
15817,The Third Man,"Despite his limited appearance, Welles has remained the face of The Third Man for years, and rightfully so. His eleventh hour performance is one of the best of his career, and without it, the movie wouldn't be quite as memorable.",4/5
15818,The Third Murder (Sandome no satsujin),"The Third Murder offers the satisfactions of a well-constructed suspense story, with twists that come from the characters of its principals, not plot contrivances.",5/5
15819,The Thorn in the Heart,A frequently mundane ramble that doesn't often put its raison d'tre on the screen.,2.5/4
15820,The Three Caballeros,"[After the] headlong launch into that abstract fantasia of color and sound, it's difficult to deny the sexual nature of its characters' pelvic thrusts and rampant phallic imagery. Clearly, this is Disney's horniest animated feature.",4/4
15821,The Three Musketeers,Lively and bawdy retelling of the classic.,4/5
15822,The Ticket,The Ticket is the equivalent of wandering around a house stripped to its support beams: every painstakingly obvious detail of its construction can be seen from virtually any vantage point.,D
15823,The Tiger Hunter,A lighthearted look at the pursuit of the elusive American Dream from the perspective of a lovesick expat from the Subcontinent.,4/4
15824,The Tillman Story,"That screening was for the people of Park City -- normal folks, not the Hollywood types who make up 99 percent of the temporary Sundance population. These average Utah citizens thought The Tillman Story was terrific, and I did too.",4/5
15825,The Time Being,"[Viewers] won't find much here besides Langella's typically austere performance, some lazy character sketches (what's up with the one-note shrewish wife?) and the sensation one gets after having watched paint dry, painfully slowly, on a canvas.",2/5
15826,The Times of Harvey Milk,"If there is a finer, more moving documentary than this, I have yet to see it.",5/5
15827,The Tin Drum (Die Blechtrommel),Schlndorff's treatment of this material is horribly flawed because he's too interested in making the audience feel comfortable before he starts damning everything.,2/4
15828,The Titan,Remember that period back in 2009 when Sam Worthington was tipped to be Hollywood's next big lead man? If ever that notion needed a final nail hammering into its coffin...,3/10
15829,The To Do List,"Essentially the film aims to trade in the awkwardness of teen sexuality, but too often settles for the gross-out gag instead.",2/4
15830,The Toe Tactic,And you thought Miranda July was twee.,1/4
15831,The Tomorrow Man,"A low-key, charming, and perfect reminder that we should all live in the moment and stop worrying so much about our future.",4/5
15832,The Tortured,...a passable horror effort that remains a marginal cut above its direct-to-video brethren.,2.5/4
15833,The Tower,"""The Tower"" may be skillfully executed as an effects-laden opus, but its miniature portraits in courage are ultimately too jerry-built to feel like anything but filler between the combustive set pieces.",2/5
15834,The Town,"Affleck's directing outshines the writing he did with Peter Craig and Aaron Stockard, but there's a lot to like here.",4/5
15835,The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"While ""Town That Dreaded Sundown"" is ambitious and supremely weird, it fails to cohere into something more resonant.",C+
15836,The Toxic Avenger: Part II,"Lacks the energy of its predecessor, but there's enough campy cheeze to entertain the schlock fans.",2.5/5
15837,The Traitor,"The Traitor is big, bold, confident film-making.",3/5
15838,The Transporter Refueled,"Statham has been replaced by the younger, blander Ed Skrein​, who shares his predecessor's Cockney accent but looks more male model than bruiser.",2.5/5

15840,The Treasure,"You don't have to be a scholar of late 20th-century Romanian economics to get the satire. However, I suspect that those who do catch the signifiers will find even more riches in the soil.",4/5
15841,The Tree,"The combination of the stunning cinematography, restrained Magical Realism, strong acting and character driven narrative makes The Tree a mesmerising experience.",3.5/5
15842,The Tree of Life,The master filmmaker takes one step further into another plane of creative cinematic storytelling.,8/10
15843,The Tree of Wooden Clogs (L'albero degli Zoccoli),"A gentle Catholic counterpoint to angry Marxist peasant cinema acutely aware of harsh economic and social injustices, but devoid of violent revolutionary spirit.",A
15844,The Trial of Billy Jack (El Juicio de Billy Jack),"Billy Jack plays a lesser role, and while he experiences his vision quest in search of a balance between pacifism and ***-kicking, he's not the focus. And that hurts the film.",1.5/5
15845,The Trials of Darryl Hunt,"I don't want to give to much away in terms of this film because it really is fascinating, but I will say that the film helps crystalize major flaws in our legal system.",3/5
15846,The Trials Of Muhammad Ali,"Although just one of the many Ali films, this is a great look at an American hero and the price he paid to preserve freedom for us all.",8/10
15847,The Tribe,"It might sound glib, but it's the literal truth: ""The Tribe"" left us speechless.",A
15848,The Tribe (La tribu),Paco Leon is absolutely fun. [Full Review in Spanish],3/5

15850,The Trip,One of the best told love stories I've seen in years.,4/5
15851,The Trip,There's something openly refreshing about Steve Coogan's and Rob Brydon's shoot-from-the-hip bromance comedy. That tart element is the pure Britishness of the whole thing.,B
15852,The Trip to Greece,"It is an amiable journey and, if it is the last, I am going to miss the boys.",B
15853,The Trip To Italy,Coogan and Brydon are endlessly entertaining. Watching these two have a go at each other is a pleasure.,8/10
15854,The Trip to Spain,The effortless chemistry makes for a supremely pleasant vacation.,A-
15855,The Triplets of Belleville,"It may clock in at a crisp 80 minutes, yet a single viewing can barely do justice to this richly detailed and often playfully macabre adventure.",4/5
15856,The Triumph of Love,"Peploe's smarts and the deft performances can't compensate for the fact that what we're watching, however charming, is a fancifully costumed theater piece that cuts off the oxygen needed to make a play breathe onscreen.",3/5
15857,The Trouble With Angels,"Silly fluff with top-notch performers. No one else could say ""scathingly brilliant"" with as much scathing brilliance as Hayley Mills, and Russell is magnificently wry as Mother Superior.",4/5
15858,The Trouble with Bliss,Michael Knowles directs with all the complexity of a TV sitcom.,C-
15859,The Trouble with Harry,"This is a quirky and surprisingly low-key comedy that's more amusing than funny; it's witty, but rarely hilarious.",81/100

15862,The True Memoirs of an International Assassin,This lifeless and lazy action-comedy only deepens our concerns about Netflix's feature-length comedy output.,D
15863,The Trust,"The set-up is familiar by caper standards (Ocean's Eleven on a lower budget, where the cops are robbers) - what sets it apart is Cage's brazenly bizarre performance.",4/5
15864,The Truth About Emanuel,There is a real beauty and heartbreak to Emanuel and the Truth About Fishes that simultaneously haunts and warms every frame.,4/5
15865,The Tunnel,The audience is teased with fleeting glimpses of the threat lurking in the shadows and its first real appearance is played so well it is a thing of horror poetry.,4/5
15866,The Turin Horse,"Those who can't buy in to the long takes, frequently static camerawork and repetetive style, will struggle to stay fidget-free. Yet, if you are willing to fall into Tarr's deliberate rhythm, there is a beauty to his story.",4/5
15867,The Turning,The magical thing about Tim Winton's The Turning is how consistently good it is. That it occasionally touches greatness makes it miraculous.,4/5
15868,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1,"The Twilight films manage to cleverly blend melodrama with supernatural thrills, and while the film is not without its silly moments and cringeworthy dialogue it does deliver the drama and emotional highs we have come to expect.",4/5
15869,The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2,"Three fingers of supernatural teen romance served neat in a dirty glass with a sparkler and cocktail umbrella, and not a single concession is made to newcomers, or sanity.",3/5
15870,The Two Faces of January,"It's an elegantly pleasurable period thriller, a film of tidy precision and class.",4/5
15871,The Two Jakes,"It's not a thriller and it's not a whodunit, although it contains thriller elements and at the end we do find out whodunit. It's an exquisite short story about a mood, and a time, and a couple of guys who are blind-sided by love.",3.5/4
15872,The Two of Us (Le vieil homme et l'enfant),Berri made his feature-directing debut with this serious-minded 1967 comedy about a Jewish boy living with an anti-Semitic farmer while evading Nazi terror.,3/4
15873,The Two Popes,"Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins engage in a theological joust, equal parts levity, humor, and spiritual exploration. There is no resolution of millennia-old debates, just amusing exposition and proselytizing",B+
15874,The Ultimate Life,Its thinly veiled message of social conservatism and religious affirmations as the pathway to an ideal life is delivered with all the predigested sentimentality of a Hallmark card.,1/4
15875,The Ultimate Warrior,"This film should have been entertaining, but instead felt tiresome.",C-
15876,The Uncondemned,"Along with telling the story of the accomplishment of the prosecutors in this case, the documentary uses its platform as an opportunity to say something bigger about how women are treated today, across the world.",4/5
15877,The Undefeated,"Make up your mind, people: Is she a tough-as-nails ""Mama Grizzly"" or is she a fragile female who needs men to stick up for her?",1.5/5
15878,The Unforeseen,"Although Dunn focuses on the particular situation as it has unfolded in Austin, the film is universal, working as a microcosmic model of similar struggles taking place all over the country.",4/5
15879,The Unicorn,"Some good scenes, funny performances and sparkling banter make this worthy of rom-com silver, if not quite rom-com gold.",2.5/4
15880,The Unknown Girl (La fille inconnue),"A run-of-the-mill, plodding drama, the 'social realism' of which never feels particularly real.",2/5
15881,The Unknown Known,"Rumsfeld is too smooth an operator to let anything slip, and when confronted with a question he doesn't much like, he simply clicks the detour button on his verbal sat nav and talks his way around it.",2/5
15882,The Unseen,"The Unseen may take its time, but it's definitely worth it. It delivers a new approach to a classic story with an unexpected emotional impact that lingers, and it is well worth seeking out.",4/5
15883,The Unspeakable Act,You couldn't accuse the cast members of being good actors (several struggle to be merely amateurish).,3/5
15884,The Upside,"[Bryan] Cranston and [Kevin] Hart fight tooth and nail to keep the film as charming as possible, though, with Hart going to particularly impressive lengths. It almost works, until you remember it shouldn't.",2.5/4
15885,The Valet,"Ah, the French. They've been so good at mining romantic entanglement for veins of comedy for so long they more or less own the lease. While that may be argued, this bomblet of bumbling unbelievability will tickle us in the right places.",4/5

15891,The Vatican Tapes,The bad news is the apocalypse is coming. The good news is you'll be too sleepy to care.,2/10
15892,The Vault,"It's a clever idea, but the script isn't nearly as smart as it's trying to be, falling back on feeble attempts to generate suspense by throwing every cliche imaginable at the screen.",2/5
15893,The VelociPastor,A haphazard mess no matter how self-aware it is about its own stupidity.,2.5/5
15894,The Very Thought of You,I would have liked to see Potter and Fiennes in a more straightforward love story without all the mechanical silliness.,2.5/4
15895,The Veteran,Toby Kebbell's war hero Robert Miller is a troubled soul. He's a handsome fella with a bit of swagger but he looks in the mirror with pure hatred and ties his tie like he's garotting himself.,3/5
15896,The Victim,"Not much happens in The Victim, but the events that do manage to transpire consistently support a reading of the film as an older man's fantasy of virility.",0/4
15897,The Villainess (Ak-Nyeo),"Although the actioner is bookended by two visceral action sequences, everything in between the opening and closing high points is melodramatic and often confusing.",C

15900,The Viral Factor,"Yes, standard stuff, but Chou and Tse have the chops for this brand of socky.",2.5/4
15901,The Virginity Hit,"Crass and vulgar, of course. It's supposed to be funny, too, but it isn't...It makes a movie like 'Superbad'...seem like Shakespeare.",F
15902,The Visit,"It's not likely that you've seen a film like The Visit before. A deeply cerebral film, it's nonetheless an entertaining one with compelling imagery and a fascinating premise.",B+
15903,The Visitor,"You'll likely you ask yourself just what you're watching several times...Whether that's a good or a bad thing is a matter of opinion, and there's a chance you'll change your mind on the subject.",3/5

15905,The Void,"The Void marks a new, more serious direction for Canadian genre filmmaking collective Astron-6.",B-
15906,The Vow,"For all its clunky scripting there's an essential sweetness at work here, thanks partly to McAdams and partly to an unusually chaste love story that ultimately keeps melodrama at bay.",3/5

15908,The Wait,"Good cast, a promising premise, faintly chilling tone. But there's no payoff, here.",2/4
15909,The Waiting Room,"Instead of an exciting big-screen debut, this feels like a Cold Feet episode, written by a fan of Brief Encounter. Duff deserves a bigger challenge.",3/5
15910,The Waiting Room,"There's more to it than a black-and-white political conclusion, and the laundry list of California documentary heroes in the credits suggests this film is humanist before it's agenda driven.",4/5
15911,The Walk,"Zemeckis creates an apparent respect and adoration of New York City and the twin towers that haven't really been seen in film post-9/11 however, his narrative tones and setup are both uninspired and dull",2/4
15912,The Walking Deceased,"This juvenile horror-comedy spoof is primarily, if unintentionally, a cautionary tale about the perils of allowing brahs to make movies.",0.5/4
15913,The Wall,"Aaron Taylor-Johnson deserves more credit as an actor, because he's the only reason this Iraq War thriller hobbles steadily on two legs.",6/10
15914,The Wanderers,"...at once dramatic, funny, tense, exciting, violent, romantic, corny, and in its own contorted way, uplifting, with Kaufman's camera always in motion.",7/10
15915,The Wannabe,"Arquette shines, but this unmade-man mob movie lacks the energy and brutally dark humor of ""Rob the Mob,"" which was about exactly the same story,.",2/4
15916,The War of the Worlds,This is an imminently watchable film -- better than many other B-grade science fiction films with similar themes of alien invasion.,3/4
15917,The War Within,An endlessly complicated movie about the potential for terrorism among American Muslims.,3/4
15918,The Ward,Not the return to form fans of director John Carpenter are hoping for.,3/10
15919,The Warring States (Zhan Guo),This busy attempt at merging large-scale CGI action filmmaking with outsized historical drama is unremarkable.,2.5/5
15920,The Watch,"""The Watch"" has lots of energy but not much inspiration.",2/4
15921,The Water Diviner,A postcard war melodrama illuminated by beautiful colours and sunshine-through-leaves lighting.,3/5
15922,The Watermelon Woman,"The narrative, abot a black lesbian director, is elliptical and circular, borrowing its format from Jim McBride's seminal David Holtzman's Diary, at the end of which, the viewers realize they have been watching a fake documentary.",B
15923,The Wave (Bolgen),"It takes the time to sketch an imperiled family worth caring about, but any goodwill is soon weathered by wave after wave of contrivance following the initial town-leveling event.",1.5/4
15924,The Wave,"The Wave is never too eager to impress its audience. It creates a more inviting atmosphere that elaborates on some heady topics, while still never losing sight of being a goofy comedy. Overall, this a daring, sharp, and satisfying jolt to the system.",B
15925,The Way Back,Brings a lot of talent and a tremendous amount of craft to a movie that will be too painful for most people to endure.,B
15926,The Way Back,"Though the focus is on Jack's journey back to himself through the device of basketball, the best moments in ""The Way Back"" are the basketball itself... The game is what makes ""The Way Back"" hum, not Jack's tragic backstory.",2.5/4
15927,The Way He Looks,"Humano, sensvel e generoso como seu protagonista.",5/5
15928,The Way Way Back,"The Way, Way Back is everything you want in a laugh out loud, crowd-pleasing, coming-of-age movie.",A
15929,The We and the I,"After several disappointing films (both studio and indies), Gondry is back on terra ferma with this account of youth in the Bronx, which is loose, rambling, and occasionally funny and poignant.",B-
15930,The Weather Underground,"A chilling, cautionary tale that needs to be seen by a wide audience. My only fear is that many will take away the wrong message from the film, thinking how daring these young revolutionaries were as they tried to blow up our government.",3.5/4
15931,The Wedding Guest,"Despite Winterbottom's excellent direction, Nuttgens' photography, and the decent acting from the two leads, the core nuts and bolts of the story fail. ""The Wedding Guest"" disappoints because its mundane screenplay.",C
15932,The Wedding Party,"I don't think it's a film that aims very high and it sort of achieves what it aims to do, I think. I found it perfectly amiable.",3/5
15933,The Wedding Plan,"A plaintive, melancholy offering that has enough of a feel-good factor to tempt the incurably romantic.",3/5
15934,The Wedding Ringer,"Ugly, rancid, vile and mean. The level of contempt ""The Wedding Ringer"" shows its characters and audience is inconceivable.",0/4
15935,The Wedding Video,"For a better Webb/wedding bet, try Confetti or Peep Show's Season 4 finale.",2/5
15936,The Wedding Year,"While much of the movie is rather corny and predictable, there are some hilarious sequences along the way, mainly thanks to a cast adept at finding the funny side in their characters.",3/5
15937,The Week Of,"Laughter-free, joke-free and entertainment-free abomination.",0/5
15938,The Weekend,"SNL alum Zamata is a natural, bringing a sarcastic spontaneity and danger to her performance.",3/5
15939,The Well-Digger's Daughter,"here's a broad appeal to be gleaned from its antiquated charm, modest focus and a clutch of ripe, old-school character turns, especially from Auteuil in the lead and French stalwarts Jean-Pierre Darroussin and Sabine Azma.",3/5
15940,The Whale,A gorgeous and provocative film that consistently rises above its Flipper-ish genre.,3/4
15941,The Whisperer In Darkness,...provides a good reflection of Lovecraft's obsessions while affording contemporary audiences some good old-fashioned midnight movie fun.,7/10
15942,The Whistleblower,"...a preachy, hopelessly heavy-handed piece of work...",1/4
15943,The White Crow,"A beautiful aria, buoyed by a graceful score and the elegance of the ballet.",4/5
15944,The White Haired Witch of Lunar Kingdom,"The themes are dealt with rather hastily, however. The martial arts action also feels a little truncated. But it's the central relationship, the intense, transforming romantic encounter between warrior and witch, that is the least successful element.",3/5
15945,The White Helmets,Inspiring docu has positive messages; some wartime violence.,4/5
15946,The Whole Town's Talking,Great gangster comedy . Classic Eddie G.,5/5
15947,The Whole Truth,Courtney Hunt's film ultimately plays as little more than the cinematic equivalent of a trashy airport novel.,2/4
15948,The Wicker Man,Very intelligent and engaging.,8/10
15949,The Wicker Man,"LaBute does a decent job of translating it to 2006, but the idea behind it just isn't as cool as it once was.",3/5
15950,The Wife,"This is an unmissable movie for Glenn Close fans. Actually, you can't watch it without being a fan.",5/5
15951,The Wild,There's something foul about this latest animated adventure's blatant +h toy-ready construction.,1.5/4
15952,The Wild Life,There's more than enough here to keep younger children quiet over a rainy bank holiday weekend.,3/5
15953,The Wilde Wedding,"Cluttered, never quite raucous enough, but full of lovely grace notes provided by its three grand leads -- Malvocich, Close and Stewart.",2.5/4
15954,All The Wilderness,"Despite being Michael Johnson's debut, The Wilderness Of James seems like the work of a veteran director, as it deals with one boy's struggles in a heartfelt and powerful way.",8/10
15955,The Wildest Dream: Conquest of Everest,"Just when you were fed up the whole idea of people climbing Mount Everest like it was a rollercoaster at Magic Mountain, documentarian Anthony Geffen reclaims a significant aspect of the mountain's storied history.",B+
15956,The Willoughbys,"The Willoughbys is a mishmash of story ideas strung together by the idea of found family, but it's cute and quirky enough to keep viewers hooked.",3/5
15957,The Wind,Tammi demonstrates a real knack for visual storytelling and mood; balancing tone and pace while pulling off some very creepy moments; and drawing out an understated but powerful performance from Gerard.,3.5/5
15958,The Wind Rises,"I wanted to love it, tried to love it and then went down in flames.",3/5
15959,The Wind Will Carry Us,"Abbas Kiarostami's films have a knack for taking us away to a clearer, more vivid place, allowing us to breathe for what seems like the first time in years. He has done that once again, and better than ever before, with his newest film.",4/4
15960,The Winding Stream,Wonderful ...,A-
15961,The Windmill (The Windmill Massacre),"Overall, an enjoyable film in an unlikely but imaginative setting. The legends of horror can welcome The Miller with open, bloody arms. He's a great addition to the likes of Jason and Freddy and deserves a sequel.",7/10
15962,The Winner,Whose The Winner?,5/10
15963,The Winter Guest,"[Rickman] has great command here of look and tone, and I felt I knew what it would be like to wander the streets of that village in Scotland. But the film left me feeling strangely hollow.",2.5/4
15964,The Wipers Times,"Even fleshed out with free-standing cabaret-style sketches, at 90 minutes this sometimes felt as long as waiting for the war to end all wars itself to end.",3/5
15965,The Wise Kids,"Honest, observant, and subtle.",3/4
15966,The Witch,The Witch remains a frightening look at what happens when one's unshakable faith collides with a frightening reality.,3.5/5
15967,The Witch: Subversion (Manyeo),"Despite trying to cram too much plot, the film's atmospheric score, action sequences and visuals keep you invested in the story and what comes next.",4/5
15968,The Witch Who Came from the Sea,An absurd story with no redeeming qualities,1/5
15969,The Witches,Don't miss Anjelica Huston's deliciously vile transformation from beauty to beast. And don't miss this film.,A
15970,The Wizard of Lies,The Wizard of Lies bears less of a resemblance to art than a book report.,2/4
15971,The Wizard of Oz,"Remarkable, colorful, heartwarming.",10/10
15972,The Wolf of Wall Street,"Martin Scorsese's keyed-up, irreverent tone frequently fails to distinguish itself from the grunting arias sung by the oily paragons of commerce his film evidently intended to deflate.",2/4
15973,The Wolfpack,"Not since Grey Gardens has a film invited us into such a strange, barely-functioning home and allowed us to gawk without reservation.",5/5
15974,The Wolf's Call (Le chant du loup),"A naval submarine thriller that shows, for better or worse, that French cinema is capable of much more than what is contained within art house walls.",3/5
15975,The Wolverine,The best comic book movie of the summer and one that rarely feels like a comic book movie.,8.5/10
15976,The Woman,"This is dark, challenging stuff with a dead-eye for satire and a fantastically out-of-control final act that will equally please the horror fan inside as well as the part that understands what is going on beneath the violence.",3.5/4
15977,The Woman in Black,"It's an uninspired compendium of haunted house clichs, with a twist that barely deserves to be called one.",2/5
15978,The Woman in Black 2 Angel of Death,"By no means a disaster, The Woman in Black: Angel of Death's very adequateness is its own cautionary tale. The need to keep a franchise breathing but stable, cuts off the new possibilities to make it come thrillingly alive.",6/10
15979,The Woman in the Fifth,A seriously strange little movie...,2.5/4
15980,The Women's Balcony (Ismach Hatani),A nice parable on the power of the community to face the fanaticism that will possibly piss the feminists. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
15981,The Words,The Words fails to surpass dramatically the bland lack of specificity in its title while still offering a solid roundup of performances from its talented ensemble cast.,C
15982,The World Before Her,"Extreme choices and attitudes confronting women in India are laid bare in Nisha Pahuja's quietly shocking film, the Best Canadian Feature winner at Hot Docs 2012.",3.5/4
15983,The World Before Your Feet,"Its lackadaisical start is too unassuming and a little too much basic information is withheld for a bit too long. Still, it's a genuinely pleasant film that revels in the pleasure of simply wandering this strange, beautiful world we live in.",B+
15984,The World Is Yours (Le monde ou rien),Tthere's still a sense that Gavras left a little meat on the bone -- that he could have done a bit more to flesh out everyone's fortunes. But The World Is Yours is such an intoxicating delight because it still manages to make you care.,A-
15985,The World Made Straight,"The moody lighting and the ubiquity of deciduous trees provide a canvas for bracing drama, but the film undoes itself by its desire to impart revelatory history lessons.",1.5/4
15986,The World of Apu,"The Apu Trilogy, 36 years after its completion, remains one of the screen's great gifts.",4/4
15987,The World's End,"Though hilarious in parts, and heartwarming in others, The World's End has the great misfortune of simply being branded as a ""fun"" comedy, and one that is sadly unlikely to amount to being too much more than that.",3/5
15988,The Wrestler,"The most haunting sports film, or at least the most haunting film about the margins of a sport, since Fat City",3.5/4
15989,The Wretched,"The Wretched is a wicked and suspenseful thrill until the very end -- a film that will make you weary of every dark corner in anticipation of the long, clawed hand that could reach out from within.",4.5/5
15990,The Wrong Missy,"Overriding everything is a profound sense of laziness. Jokes do not land here so much as they ooze forth, slow and noxious.",1/4
15991,The Year Dolly Parton Was My Mom,"The Year My Mom Was Dolly Parton relies on a good but not great script, well-drawn characters and performances and a pleasant, fuzzy sense of a simpler time.",2.5/4
15992,The Year of the Yao,A good-spirited and entertaining look at a famous anomaly.,3/4
15993,The Yellow Birds,"The performances go a long way... but as the narrative becomes tedious, what should be an emotional gutpunch of a conclusion ends up falling flat.",2.5/5
15994,The Yellow Sea (Hwanghae),"An epic noir thriller that contains no small amount of excitement, it suggests that Na might well be the best action director currently working in Korea.",62/100
15995,The Yes Men Are Revolting,Who would have thought that the funniest moments at the Toronto International Film Festival would revolve around climate change and activism?,3.5/4
15996,The Young Girl and the Monsoon,"Obviously the work of a playwright, this is not at all cinematic.",2/4
15997,The Young Girls of Rochefort (Les Demoiselles de Rochefort),This is one terrific musical.,A
15998,The Young Karl Marx (Le jeune Karl Marx),"August Diehl excels in the eponymous lead role, as he so often does, complete with an endearing glint in his eyes, as somebody you feel gets a real kick of out a debate, as if waiting, fervently, for somebody to have the courage to disagree with him.",2/5
15999,The Young Messiah,This kind-hearted and compassionate drama imagines the youthful life of Jesus.,3/4
16000,The Young Philadelphians,"The trials and tribulations of the rich, like those of the poor, can be undramatic.",2/5
16001,The Young Unknown,The claustrophobic and static movie is in bad need of some opening up.,2/4
16002,The Zen Of Bennett,"The way Mr. Bennett talks is the way he sings. There is no subtext, only the song conveyed with knowledge, heart, a sophisticated sense of swing and a positive attitude.",4/5
16003,The Zero Theorem,"A sagging bag of half-cooked ideas, a dystopian thriller with runaway dysentery, a film that wears its metaphorical trousers around its metaphorical ankles. In fits and starts, I quite enjoyed it.",3/5
16004,The Zookeeper's Wife,There are simply way too many [poorly executed] moments ... to recommend this without serious reservations.,3/5
16005,Theater of Blood (Theatre of Blood) (Much Ado About Murder),the inherently gruesome comedy rises naturally from the over-the-top scenarios and Price's fantastically campy performance,3/4
16006,Theeb,Theeb is a self-contained coming-of-age adventure at its core. A tense and really quite beautiful one to boot.,4/5
16007,Their Finest,"Even though 'Their Finest' falters at the end, it's still a mostly pleasant film featuring charming performances and some thoughtful subtext.",3/5
16008,Thelma,"Joachim Trier crafts a drama that is sublimely ambiguous, austere and also deeply sad and heartbreaking.",A-
16009,Thelma & Louise,"Thelma & Louise may look like just another girl-buddy road picture. But in director Ridley Scott's hands, it's propulsively more.",4.5/5
16010,Them,"So skilfully does the film shield its hand that the final ""reveal"" actually comes as a disappointment - the enigma was truly much harder to bear.",3/5
16011,Them That Follow,"It's competently made but utterly vacant, a forgettable indie fading fast.",2/5
16012,Then Came You,"[A] quirky-minded yet solidly conceived dramedy. A cheeky story that resonates soundly in its sprinkled charm and contemplation. Indeed, Then Came You is thoroughly affecting...the first official Valentine of 2019 and it throbs convincingly.",3/4
16013,Then She Found Me,"Clearly committed to the material, Hunt extracts exquisitely subtle performances from her accomplished cast-especially Firth and Midler-in this self-assured directorial debut.",3.5/5
16014,The Theory of Flight,"The Theory of Flight is actually fairly enjoyable. [But] when you see Dance Me to My Song, you're struck by the difference. Two movies. Same story. Same objective. Similar characters. Similar situation. One is an entertainment. The other is a thunderbolt.",2.5/4
16015,Theory of Obscurity: A Film About the Residents,"The film is a must-see for those who want to be introduced to the band, even if part way through you may find that you've hit your limit.",2.5/4
16016,There Be Dragons,"From its baldly overwritten dialogue to its claustrophobically stingy use of locations, Dragons is underdone in every way.",1/5
16017,There Was a Crooked Man,"O senso de humor do filme desarma de maneira brilhante o espectador, pegando-o completamente de surpresa com o cinismo de seu terceiro ato.",4/5
16018,There Will Be Blood,"It's more than a ""departure"" for director Paul Thomas Anderson; it's a monumental display of ""evolution"" that'll wow the established fans and impress a helluva lot more new ones.",4.5/5
16019,There's No Business Like Show Business,"Overstuffed and cornball, but some great Berlin musical numbers, especially Monroe's ""Heat Wave.""",4/5
16020,There's Something About Mary,There's Something about Mary is the funniest movie to come along since Liar Liar.,3.5/4

16024,These Birds Walk,"Mullick and Tariq's camera celebrates the preciousness of the lives they capture, while mourning their tenuousness in kind.",4/5
16025,These Final Hours,"What sets it apart from so many action-oriented films is that the director surrounds lead actor Nathan Philips with a strong, multigenerational cast of women.",2.5/4
16026,These Girls,"Can a yarn without credibility, can a comedy without laughs, can characters without a centre, can direction without discernment, add up to a movie?",1/4

16031,They Died With Their Boots On,"Well-made, but specious.",3/5
16032,They Got Me Covered,"It drags in some critical phases, it labors in obvious spots and the climax is too manufactured. But there are side-splitting moments in it.",2.5/5
16033,They Live,"Probably one of the most subversive films to have come out of Hollywood in decades, They Live is a welcome return to form by legendary cult film director John Carpenter.",3/4
16034,They Might Be Giants,"Madness may, indeed, make giants of us all.",7/10
16035,They Remain,"This is not a film for newcomers to the genre. It requires a familiarity with ancient things, yet it is in the unfamiliar that it anchors its emotional affect.",3/5
16036,They Wait,...a tedious and downright silly piece of work.,1.5/4
16037,They Were Expendable,Surprisingly rich film is one of the best war films ever made.,A

16039,They'll Love Me When I'm Dead,A cinephiles' delight.,A-
16040,They're Inside,"While the producers' fascination with the idea of ""people watching people"" is not in doubt, it's much less clear exactly what their contention about the ""act of seeing"" and of ""being seen"" might be.",6/10
16041,They're Watching,"Is the film savaging cable TV? Ethically challenged filmmakers? Found-footage horror itself? If the intent was to finish off this subgenre by exposing the rote mechanics behind it, the mission is only halfway accomplished.",D+
16042,Thief Of Hearts,"This is a dreary, dull and altogether grating film, one that's as derivative and simple as it is just plain boring.",1.5/5
16043,Thieves' Highway,Dassin swathes Thieves' Highway's long-haul boys in claustrophobic compositions and menacing darkness.,3.5/4
16044,Thin,This film is fascinating and sad.,4/5
16045,The Thin Blue Line,Although The Thin Blue Line assembles an almost inassailable case... it is not a conventional documentary -- not a feature-length version of one of those 60 Minutes segments in which innocent men are rescued from Death Row.,3.5/4
16046,The Convincer (Thin Ice),"[VIDEO] For all there is to admire about co-writer/director Jill Sprecher's suspenseful black comedy (a la Sam Raimi's ""A Simple Plan)"" third act disappointment rains on the parade.",C
16047,A Thin Line Between Love and Hate,"Martin Lawrence bites off a bit more than he can chew with his four roles in this haphazard comedy. As a result, nothing seems quite focused.",1/4
16048,The Thin Man,Loy and Powell set a style for connubial comic banter which many performers still attempt in vain to duplicate today.,4.5/5
16049,The Thing About My Folks,A piece about a father-son reconciliation lacks originality.,C
16050,The Thing Called Love,"Aside from its blatantly commercial aspirations and predictable storyline, there is an appealing cast, enjoyable songs and some funny bits of business.",2.5/4
16051,Things to Do,Things to Do is the perfect modest alternative to the other infinitely more unremarkable attempts at addressing the hopes and fears of a restless generation.,A-
16052,Things Behind the Sun,"This is a hard film to watch, and yet it adheres to a perspective important for both men and women to see.",4/5
16053,Things Change,Things Change is a neat little exercise in wit and deception.,3/4

16055,Things to Come,"Simplistic, but great looking and with a great Arthur Bliss score",3/5
16056,Things to Come (L'avenir),"Things to Come is a smart, earnest undertaking: an exploration of the insecurity that can hit any of us, at any age, when we start to question the life we've built.",4/5
16057,Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead,"Yet another debut about urban lowlifes filmed by wanna-be Tarantinos, Denver boasts a distinctive personality and a colorful cast that any police lineup would be proud to call its own.",3/4

16072,Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,"[The filmmakers] discover no great answers or revelations, but by the end of the film they, and we, have a remarkable impression of a life lived curiously, but well.",4/4
16073,Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,"Mervyn LeRoy's fact-based WWII action-drama was extremely popular due to subject matter, star power (Spencer Tracy), Oscar-winning effects, and intelligent script by Dalton Trumbo, later blacklisted and one of the Hollywood Ten.",B+
16074,36 quai des orfevres,"Former police officer Olivier Marchal has directed a beautifully acted, shot and scored cop thriller that is a very worthy addition to France's near domination of the genre.",B+
16075,This Beautiful City,"A sense of coherence is not helped by an arty, handheld-camera feeling.",2/4
16076,This Ain't No Mouse Music!,"""This Ain't No Mouse Music"" works, in large part, because of Strachwitz's unbridled -- and some would say unrivaled -- enthusiasm for Americana music.",3/4

16078,This Boy's Life,The movie is very involving.,3.5/4
16079,This Changes Everything,Klein is an excellent synthesizer of difficult ideas and knows how to make them accessible.,3/5

16081,This Divided State,"Competent, surprisingly cohesive and coherent and it does its best to tell all sides of the story.",3/4
16082,This Girl's Life,"This Girl's Life was a standout at the CineVegas Film Festival; the best of the lot. James Woods is in great form as usual and if Juliette Marquis is not a star within the next five years, then you can judge me all you want.",3.5/4
16083,This Is 40,"This relentlessly hilarious and quietly moving riff on middle-aged growing pains stands as a rare spin-off that outdoes the material it spawned from, and is Judd Apatow's best feature to date.",4.5/5
16084,This Is Elvis,"The movie's lesson is brutal, sad, and inescapable: Elvis Presley was a man who gave joy to a great many people but felt very little of his own, because he became addicted and stayed addicted until the day it killed him.",3.5/4
16085,This Is England,"Superbly written and directed by Shane Meadows and featuring a terrific soundtrack, this is a compelling coming of age drama with a brilliant performance from young Thomas Turgoose.",5/5

16087,This Is My Life,"What's new about This is My Life is that it's an argument between the two points of view -- with the mother and her daughters each demanding their own rights. There is humor in this approach, and also some truth.",3/4
16088,This Is Not a Film,"This Is Not A Film is pleasing mainly just as a message-in-a-bottle from a restless, persecuted artist -- that is, until the amazing closing shot, which brings the volatility of post-Green Revolution Iran home with unforgettable force.",B+
16089,This is not Berlin,Sama refuses to simplify the complexities of adolescence at a time of rebellion (something you could argue is adolescence by definition).,B+
16090,This Is Spinal Tap,"Reiner's brilliant ""rockumentary"" sends up its subject matter and the documentary form, with such deft perception that confusing it with the genuine article is an easy mistake to make.",5/5
16091,This Is the End,This Is The End is a vanity project that hopes that audiences will enjoy hanging out with Seth and the gang as much as they like hanging out with each other.,C
16092,One Direction: This Is Us,"They rattle through all the hits, like Kiss You, Rock Me and I Would: songs that leave you pining for the harmonic complexity and lyrical daring of Justin Bieber.",2/5
16093,This Is Where I Leave You,"This is Where I Leave You is totally amiable, utterly unmoving filler given a major shot in the arm by its cast, people it's simply a pleasure to watch, even with the creeping feeling they're better than this.",2/5
16094,This Land Is Mine,"It should have been stronger drama than it is. But for the points it does make and its concept of man as a continuing vessel for freedom's fire, it is certainly well worth seeing. It comes close, even if doesn't quite hit the mark.",3/5
16095,This Means War,"Watching really attractive, really charismatic people be really funny seldom gets old, and they're served reasonably well by a tight, disciplined script that capitalises on their game charms.",3/5
16096,This Must Be The Place,I'm not entirely sure how to articulate why I enjoyed it so much.,B

16101,This Sporting Life,It's impossible not to appreciate the remarkable performances (both Harris and Roberts were nominated for Oscars) or the realistic rugby scenes that earned Harris a broken leg.,3/4
16102,This Teacher,Herzi commands attention in the central role - her performance offers a similar potency to Helena Howard in Madeline's Madeline - as her character experiences something lurking on the knife-edge between divine revelation and mental breakdown.,4/5

16115,"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri","With McDormand as the Greek Chorus for the left side of hatred and Rockwell the bumbling bumper sticker for the right side of hatred, it's unfortunate that Harrelson's Sheriff is eventually reduced to a deus ex machina character.",2.5/5
16116,The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada,"A revenge Western that will do Peckinpah and Eastwood proud, this is a morality tale with political overtones about the culture clash between white Americans and Mexicans",B
16117,Three Came Home,Harrowing war tale.,B+
16118,Three Christs,"Avnet never lets the picture lapse into ""cute,"" but there are moments, here and there, that seem off-key or gratuitous.",2.5/4

16120,Three Colors: Blue (Trois Couleurs: Bleu),"Blue is a movie that engages the mind, challenges the senses, implores a resolution, and tells, with aesthetic grace and formal elegance, a good story and a political allegory.",4/5
16121,Three Colors: White (Trois Couleurs: Blanc),"There's something earthy and elemental in this tale that was missing in Blue, something quirky and (measured by Kieslowskian standards) energetic. But there's also something damp and brown, like the sodden Polish countryside he pictures.",B

16123,The Three Faces of Eve,"It once seemed daring, now it seems simplistic.",3/5

16125,Three Godfathers,Gorgeously photographed Ford version of the often filmed story.,4/5
16126,Three Identical Strangers,"Three Identical Strangers does a solid job laying out a story that's both remarkable and repulsive in equal measures, a window into the peculiar bonding of twins that holds appeal for the same reasons that inspired the medical research in the first place",B
16127,Three Kings,Three Kings does just about everything right. That's why it's the best picture of the year so far.,A
16128,Three Men and a Baby (3 Men and a Baby),The movie never steps wrong as long as it focuses on the developing love between the two big men and the tiny baby.,3/4

16130,Three Night Stand,"This is a happily-ever-after story with a difference: not happily, necessarily, but maybe less miserable.",3/5
16131,Three O'Clock High,Even a dumb teen movie such as this has to end with one of those fist fights where every blow sounds like the special effects guys are whacking bicycle seats with Ping-Pong paddles. Is that all life is? The vicious define the terms?,1/4
16132,Three of Hearts,"The screenplay by Adam Greenman and Mitch Glazer understands the old screwball formulas without being tied to them, and the characters are allowed the freedom to develop in unexpected ways.",3/4

16138,Three Wishes,The script is draggy and overly obvious except for a mystifying mumbo-jumble of special effects.,2/4
16139,Three Worlds,"A little too deliberately balanced in its depiction of its three leads, but it largely makes up the difference with its informed grounding in the economic and social terrain of contemporary France.",2.5/4
16140,The 3 Worlds of Gulliver,"Not a top-notch Harryhausen, but still descent with a fine Herrmann score.",3/5
16141,Three...Extremes (Saam gaang yi),"This high profile anthology of shorts by Fruit Chan, Park Chan-wook, and Takashi Miike is related by their chilling structuralist rigor.",3/4
16142,Threesome,"Threesome, by falling into the common trap of mistaking pretentiousness for substance, loses its way early on.",2/4
16143,Thriller,"All in all, this isn't as strong a film as it might have been but it's still a welcome contribution to a subgenre that has been dominated by white people for far too long.",3.5/5

16145,Through a Lens Darkly: Black Photographers and the Emergence of a People,It's essential info presented with little imagination.,3/5
16146,Throw Momma from the Train,"""Throw Momma from the Train"" is a series of missed opportunities and unexploited situations, a movie that wants to have genuine nastiness at its heart but never quite works up the energy or the nerve to be truly heartless.",2/4
16147,A Throw of Dice,"Extravagantly romantic, with a stirring score by Nitin Sawhney.",4/5
16148,Thumbsucker,"Thumbsucker is much more than a poignant coming-of-age tale, it addresses the existential fears and emotional doubts of both parents and children.",B+
16149,Thunder and the House of Magic,"The House of Magic features appealing character designs and impressive 3D work, but considering the title, it's rather limited in imagination.",3/5
16150,Thunder Road,"Thunder Road lands on a tragic development, but upends it with a single teary-eyed moment that hints - with no real evidence - that better things may be around the corner.",B+
16151,Thunder Soul,"Moving and joyful, an authentic pleaser for crowds of all ages, inspiring for people in all seasons of life.",5/5
16152,Thunderball,"With a few edits Thunderball could have been one of the best Bond films, but as it is, it's still one of the better ones.",3/4
16153,Thunderbirds,"Filmed in a zany, colourful style reminiscent of the Spy Kids movies, this is enjoyable fun until earnest lines of dialog bring everything to a shrieking stop.",2.5/5
16154,Thunderbirds Are Go,"...there's no denying that the film could've benefited from an introduction to the saga, as it's almost impossible for neophytes to penetrate...",2/4

16173,Till Human Voices Wake Us,"Absent a strong narrative momentum, you'd have to settle for nice bucolic scenery and a picture of supernatural preciosity.",2.5/4
16174,Till the Clouds Roll By,Flat biopic of Jerome Kern salvaged by some production numbers.,3/5
16175,Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie,"In a timid comic world, Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie feels genuinely dangerous and transgressive: it makes a virtue of going way too far because other comedies don't go far enough.",B+
16176,Timber Falls,"Earns a few points for sheer silliness once Act III rolls around, but you'll have to muddle through a whole lot of familiar tedium to get there. Nice scenery, though.",2/5
16177,Timbuktu,"Timbuktu inarguably stands on its own merits as a distinctive film told with both authenticity and artistry, that makes human and visceral the kind of stories that most Western eyes read only as news headlines, if that.",B+
16178,Time After Time,A lightweight literary fantasy film.,C
16179,Time Bandits,"Time Bandits is probably Terry Gilliam's most accessible film. Brazil will always be known as his greatest artistic achievement, but for sheer entertainment Time Bandits is one of his best.",3/4

16187,Time Regained,"Time Regained does not tell a story, and you will be disappointed if you go looking for one... It is not about memories but memory. Yours, mine, Proust's. Memory makes us human.",3.5/4
16188,Time Share (Tiempo Compartido),"Creepy, clever and caustic, Time Share is a terrific film that crawls under your skin",A
16189,The Time That Remains,"What makes the film more than a litany of justified grief is its black humour. Suleiman deploys distinctively photographed tableaux, idiosyncratic characters and a stand-up comic's sense of timing to evoke the absurdity of the modern political situation.",5/5
16190,Time Trap,"Time Trap is highly creative, populated with relatable characters, with a whip-smart script. Sadly, the very end of the movie undoes the tense atmosphere setup throughout. While it does not ruin the film, it does leave one a bit disappointed.",7.5/10
16191,The Time Traveler's Wife,"Combining elements of sweepingly romantic time travel movies like Somewhere In Time and the supernatural swoon of Ghost, this first-rate and spellbinding drama is out to prove true love can overcome any obstacle-in this world or the next.",3.5/5

16219,To Have and Have Not,To Have and Have Not (1944) was director Howard Hawks' wartime adventure masterpiece - a minor film classic loosely based upon part of Ernest Hemingway's 1937 novel of the same name. Jules Furthman and William Faulkner partnered their talents,A
16220,To Kid or Not to Kid,"Strong arguments hold that having children is in some cases a selfish choice. Not having children, by contrast, is not selfish.",B
16221,To Kill A Mockingbird,"To Kill A Mockingbird (1962) is a much-loved, critically-acclaimed, classic trial film. It exhibits a dramatic tour-de-force of acting, a portrayal of childhood innocence (told from a matured adult understanding),and a progressive, enlightened 60s message",A
16222,To Kill a Priest,"To Kill a Priest is a movie of great, almost crushing, sincerity, but it is so ineptly made that scene after scene strikes the wrong note, or no note at all.",2/4

16271,Too Late Blues,Interesting mainly for its jazz atmosphere and Darin's nonsinging performance.,2.5/4
16272,Too Much Sun,Mr. Downey is a funny man.,3/5
16273,Toolbox Murders,"This one might just be a small blip on the current Horror Remake horizon, but it's a knowingly nasty and entirely enjoyable throwback to a slashier time.",3.5/5
16274,Tooth and Nail,"A well-acted, professionally lensed post-apocalyptic thriller.",2.5/4
16275,The Tooth Fairy,"The gore scenes deliver in spades, and I give a lot of credit to the filmmakers for keeping the monster away from making stupid jokes as it kills people.",3/5
16276,Tootsie,"It's jaunty, witty, and somehow satisfying despite being simple.",4/5
16277,"Top Cat Begins (Don Gato, el inicio de la pandilla)",It respects the core characters but doesn't offer anything new. [Full review in Spanish],2/5
16278,Top End Wedding,Top End Wedding is a fun and entertaining romantic comedy that takes advantage of the sights that Northern Australia has to offer.,4/5
16279,Top Five,"While Rock calls in a lot of friends for backup on ""Top Five,"" his confidence as a leading man, writer and director had never been sharper.",A-
16280,Top Gun,"Top Gun is the type of movie that turns the screen into an altar. Kneeling before its slick façade of 1980s magnificence, you are in the shadow of a film that has defined the modern day action blockbuster.",5/5
16281,Top Hat,"Even if you can't quite appreciate the music, sit back and get clued in to why Fred Astaire is one of the movies' all-time great physical performers.",A
16282,Topaz,"Hitchcock's notorious reliance on stock footage and his affection for blue screening rather than adding veracity or contributing to the artifice of the filmmaking process, make it seem like his heart isn't really in it.",69/100
16283,Topkapi,"It's fun, light hearted, smart and wildly entertaining.",76/100
16284,The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls,"Untouchable Girls is a remarkable, moving and inspirational account of their cheerfully subversive lives.",3.5/4
16285,Topper Returns,Really funny sequel that outdoes its predecessors.,4/5
16286,Tora! Tora! Tora!,A must-see for any war buff.,3.5/5
16287,Torn Curtain,"In these times, with James Bonds cutting capers and pallid spies coming in out of the cold, Mr. Hitchcock will have to give us something a good bit brighter to keep us amused.",2/5
16288,Tortilla Soup,"A gem of ensemble acting with a warm, subtle performance by Hector Elizondo as a master chef overseeing three daughters.",3/4
16289,Tortoise In Love,"Does its best to follow rom-com convention, but without a spark between the leads, a captivating narrative or decent dollop of humour, fails to do the minimum required...",2/5
16290,Toss It,The film's eventual conclusion seems like little reward after nearly two hours of soul-searching dialogue.,2/10
16291,Total Eclipse,"It lacks any sense of humor, and is under the delusion that its subjects are interesting because they are great poets. That only makes their poetry interesting.",2.5/4
16292,Total Recall,You'd think by the year 2084 villains would have learned they shouldn't mess with Mr. Biceps. But no-o-o-o.,3/4
16293,Total Recall,"It's like a cover song by a decent, but forgettable tribute band. Their rendition hits all the proper notes, but lacks soul.",6/10
16294,Touch The Sound,"The film is a paean to the variety of sound in our world, sound that we experience very differently from how Evelyn Glennie does.",5/10
16295,A Touch of Class,"A fine romantic comedy with a poignant, unexpected ending.",3.5/5
16296,A Touch of Zen,A real masterpiece that deserves its place in film history.,4/5

16298,Touched With Fire,Both Kirby and Holmes are extraordinary.,9/10
16299,Touching Wild Horses,Take your good intentions and put them in your bum. This is as dull and pointless a film as I've seen in ages.,D+
16300,Touching the Void,"Seriously blurring the line between documentary and dramatic filmmaking, this true story is absolutely gripping.",4/5
16301,Touchy Feely,"Shelton's migration towards more clear-cut drama is hampered by uneven tone and, most damning of all, dullness.",1/5
16302,The Tourist,Another painfully dull movie about an American in Europe hoping to capitalize on the looks and fame of its stars.,5/10
16303,All the Mornings of the World (Tous Les Matins du Monde),"This is a simple story, made of three things: music, love, and regret.",3/4

16305,Towelhead,"An engrossing, unforgettable film, if more than a little incendiary.",3/4
16306,Tower,"Utilizing an engaging mix of newly filmed footage rotoscoped  la Waking Life, archival materials, and interviews, Tower employs a verbatim style to capture the harrowing events of August 1, 1966.",B+
16307,Tower Block,The interesting premise is undermined at every turn by idiotic characters and overwhelming contrivance.,2.5/5
16308,Tower Heist,"The movie's brash, forgettable fun - no Ocean's 11, but a darn sight better than Ocean's 12.",3/5
16309,The Towering Inferno,"Much more than a way to pass a rainy bank holiday afternoon, this is rocking good superleague disaster adventure...",4/5
16310,Town & Country,"... dead-set on proving that the 50-+ crowd can be just as unprincipled as teens, and ten times as boring.",43/100
16311,The Town That Dreaded Sundown,"Most students of horror cinema will slap themselves awake solely for the murder scenes, which generally don't reward one's attention.",2/5
16312,The Toxic Avenger,Simply one of the most embarassingly entertaining movies I've ever seen!,4/4
16313,Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger IV,"Laughs are few and far between, and the film feels brutally long.",1.5/4
16314,Toxic Beauty,"Toxic Beauty might be a documentary about the unseen killers lurking in one's household, but it's also a hopeful tool for change.",8/10
16315,The Toy,"Clearly, heavy-handed social commentary, cheesy slapstick and kiddie comedy aren't the most compatible of components to shoehorn into one movie.",57/100
16316,Toy Story,"I can hardly imagine having more fun at the movies than I did at Toy Story, the miraculous new Disney feature that's the first full-length animated film to be produced entirely on computer.",A
16317,Toy Story 2,The Godfather of animated films.,3.5/4
16318,Toy Story 3,"Woody, Buzz and the gang are back on the screen and that's cause for major celebration for moviegoers.",5/5
16319,Toy Story 4,"I don't think anything can surpass Toy Story 3 for emotional heft (If it didn't break you, you aren't human) so 4 wisely doesn't try. It makes up for it with laughs - lots of laughs.",5/5
16320,Toy Story of Terror!,Horror film-themed TV special is sweet treat for families.,5/5
16321,Toy Story That Time Forgot,"Delivering humor, heart and a toy-filled adventure, Toy Story that Time Forgot is another wonderful, entertaining and playful installment to the Toy Story franchise.",4.5/5
16322,Toys,"The production design deserves Academy recognition. But at the most fundamental level, Toys is a film not quite sure what it's about.",2.5/4
16323,Toys In The Attic (Na Pude),Barta's shorts are available on DVD; you're better off getting a dose of the uncut goods.,2/5
16324,Tracers,"'Twilight' alum Taylor Lautner gets physical in a gritty-glossy New York story of crime, star-crossed love and Parkour-style stunts for an agreeably lightweight time-killer thriller.",3/5
16325,Track 29,"The reason I didn't like Track 29 is that the film is unlikable -- perhaps deliberately so. But that doesn't make it a bad film, and it probably makes it a more interesting one.",3/4
16326,Tracker,An old-fashioned adventure yarn that tramps reassuringly through familiar terrain. At least the destination - not to mention the casting - is more interesting than the journey.,3/5
16327,Tracks,Stark reality mingled with paranoid fantasies in this film about a Vietnam veteran accompanying a fallen friend's body across the US for a proper burial give it an uneasy feeling.,3/5
16328,Tracy Morgan: Staying Alive,"He is in command every minute he's onstage, exhibiting flawless comic timing in a routine that is liberally peppered with four-letter words, but big on both humor and, yes, heart.",3/4
16329,Trade of Innocents,"Trade of Innocents is as much a piece of social-justice campaigning as it is a work unto itself, an important fact to remember when considering its many flaws.",1/4
16330,Trading Mom,While you're at it trade this flick in too,2/5
16331,Trading Paint,"Travolta tries to inject some emotional life into a story about car racing and family, but cliches and rough editing eventually win out in the end.",C
16332,Trading Places,"This is one of the best comedies of the 1980s, featuring a cast at the height of their powers.",4/5
16333,Traffic Stop,[Kate] Davis has created a deeply moving portrait of a woman whose life is turned upside down by callous police brutality and racism.,A-
16334,Trafficked,"Generic, dull human trafficking/sex trade thriller",1.5/4
16335,Traffik,"Melodramatic, cliched, but at least they got their glossy, their barely-clad Paula Patton shots in.",1.5/4

16337,Trail of the Pink Panther,Cinematic graverobbing at its most unsavory.,1/5
16338,Trailer Park Boys: The Movie,"A faithful and funny, entirely scripted, feature-length film version of the videotaped and improvised mockumentary series.",3/4
16339,The Train Robbers,The result is a movie that isolates the John Wayne mystique and surrounds it with the necessary simplicity and directness.,3/4
16340,Train to Busan (Busanhaeng),"Train To Busan is a viciously entertaining ride for the most part, but it's bookended with a needless introductory sequence and an extremely cheesy ending that borders on comical. Removal of these flaccid parts off would have made it a slicker journey.",3/5
16341,Training Day,You are easily drawn into the gangsta lifestyle and the movie's well written dialogue and briskly edited pace keep you interested.,6/10
16342,Trainspotting,Trainspotting is one of the most effective anti-drug movies I've seen in a long time. Its depiction of heroin addiction is so raw and gritty that you walk away with the realization that heroin is a drug not to be messed with.,3/4
16343,Trainwreck,"""Trainwreck"" allows a new development and angle to Apatow's trademark anxieties through a unique point of view, and is one of his most hilarious and finely-tuned films to date.",A-
16344,Traitor,"Making Traitor something more than a disposable B-movie was possible, but at this point in the release calendar, way more effort than it was worth.",2.5/5
16345,Tramps,A pair of the most charming performances of the year.,B+
16346,Trance,Trance is a lucid cinematic dream that combines popcorn entertainment with artistic style and brains. It's the gold standard for 2013 that all other films are going to have to live up to.,5/5
16347,Trancers,"A mish-mash of 50's and 80's retro that is laughable at best. But you can certainly do worse when you're in the mood for a ""drive-in"" kind of night",3/5
16348,Transamerica,Transamerica: What's your daddy's bra size?,8/10
16349,Transcendence,"'Transcendence' is a stiff, but one that is produced with enough polish that it almost successfully disguises its true nature.",C-
16350,Transformer,"It's the directness and non-prescriptive nature of this footage that makes Transformer a worthy portrait of a subject who, at the end of the day, is most compelling for her consistency amidst enormous changes.",3/4
16351,Transformers: Age of Extinction,"You know what you're in for if you buy a ticket, and Bay seems determined to wear you down with the biggest craziest 'Transformers' movie yet.",B-
16352,Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"[It] might struggle to equal the sheer exhilaration of Bay's 2007 trilogy-starter, but it's a whole lot more coherent and fulfilling than Revenge Of The Fallen.",3/5
16353,Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"A super-sized second helping, but the novelty factor and some of the charm's gone. Hey, at least there's more Megatron / Starscream squabbling this time round.",3/5
16354,Transformers: The Last Knight,"A movie that is at once loud yet incoherent, complex yet idiotic, and expensive yet worthless.",1/5
16355,Transformers,"Reaction in Taormina Fest signals popular franchise, and artistically what might have been like a big, noisy amusement park with lots of attractions (subplots, robots) is more unified and involving due to Spielberg's creative input and LaBeouf's acting",B+
16356,The Transformers - The Movie,American Anime before Anime was cool.,4/5
16357,Transit,"Entertaining, fast-paced, pulpy thriller enlivened by colourful performances, a decent script and a hefty dose of violence, though it mysteriously neglects a couple of obvious opportunities and has the occasional unintentionally laughable moment.",3/5
16358,Transit,"It's an engrossing, uncanny and somewhat disturbing film, and completes something of a trio of historical melodramas after Barbara and his worldwide hit Phoenix, but develops the themes of those in an adventurous, if oblique, way.",B+
16359,Transpecos,The filmmaking team is obviously committed and it's a brisk suspenseful 86 minutes. And the acting is really good.,B+
16360,The Transporter,The Transporter really delivers.,4/5
16361,Transporter 2,The Transporter 2 is a martial arts-obsessed action movie inadvertently reconceived as cartoonish parody.,1.5/4
16362,Transporter 3,"As disposable as a travel toothbrush, and an effective palate cleanser between the boredom of Twilight and the heavy Oscar contenders coming soon.",3/5
16363,Transsiberian,"Whenever you may think you know where things are going, Anderson throws a number of clever and unexpected twists that keeps you on your toes.",7/10
16364,Transylmania,"One laugh -- Vampires, stuffed in their coffins on a horse-drawn wagon, whining to the driver -- ""Are ve DERE yet?""",1/4
16365,Transylvania 6-5000,Whoa.,2/5
16366,Trap For Cinderella,"Very clearly, this is a women's film devised by men and, for our leading ladies, that's the trap.",2/5
16367,Trapeze,"Boas atuaes de Lancaster e Curtis (alm de Lollobrigida, detestvel em boa parte do filme) e timas cenas no trapzio. O final  um pouco decepcionante, mas, no geral, o filme prende e  bem realizado.",4/5
16368,Trapped in Paradise,"It should be preserved by the Library of Congress, as an example of creative desperation. It plays like a documentary about a group of actors forced to perform in a screenplay that contains not one single laugh, or moment of wit, or flash of intelligence.",0.5/4
16369,Trash Humpers,Korine is just too old for this s**t,0/4
16370,Trash,"With its heavy plotting, Trash hardly aspires to docudrama, yet the trio paint an indelible portrait of youth in crisis that is essential to the movie's success.",4/5
16371,Trashed,A patchy but grimly compelling documentary about the environmental threat of rubbish.,3/5
16372,Trauma,"By the time the narrative starts heading somewhere remotely interesting (i.e. a murder or a revelation or just SOMEthing), you may be too groggy to notice...",2/5
16373,Travelers and Magicians,What salvages the film is the powerful simplicity of its faith.,3/4
16374,Travels With My Aunt,"George Cukor's Travels with My Aunt is a whimsical romantic fantasy that works; which is to say, if you are not a fan of whimsical romantic fantasy, it's going to be too much for you.",2.5/4
16375,Tread,"Paul Solet's Tread takes a little while to grab the audience; however, once the stakes are fully understood, it becomes quite intense.",8/10
16376,Treasure Island,"You may not like Treasure Island when you see it, but what you can't dismiss is that it's definitely not commercial.",2/4
16377,The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"The film plays as a morality fable, showing that the deadliest dangers to man are in his soul and not from the external dangers.",B
16378,Treasure Planet,"Owes more to the swashbuckling serials of yesteryear cinema than it does to cold, steely science fiction ponderings of the future.",3.5/5
16379,The Treatment,"While it has an understated poise, the film's portrait of inner male turmoil isn't particularly unique or profound.",2.5/4
16380,Treeless Mountain,"Kim is undoubtedly a skilled director, but she's someone who seems more content to observe than state.",53/100
16381,Trees Lounge,"Steve Buscemi, who plays Tommy and also wrote and directed the film, knows about alcoholism from the inside out and backward, and his movie is the most accurate portrait of the daily saloon drinker I have ever seen.",3.5/4
16382,Trekkies,My enjoyment of this sci-fi series is nothing compared with the fanaticism of hard-core devotees of Gene Roddenberry's cultural phenomenon.,7/10
16383,Trembling Before G-d,A poignant doc about how gay Jews try to deal with the Biblical prohibition against homosexual acts.,3/4
16384,Tremors,"Sure, this is 1950s B-movie type stuff but Tremors is fast-paced, funny and clever enough to make it all worth watching.",3/4
16385,Tremors 2: Aftershocks,"Not the worst straight to video sequel possible, has some fun moments.",3/5
16386,Tremors 3 - Back to Perfection,"All in all, taken for what it is, Tremors 3 is worth a gander.",2.5/5
16387,Tremors: A Cold Day in Hell,"Either way, as long as they can devise clever sequences of graboid attacks, Tremors can rumble along forever.",3.5/5
16388,Trespass,"Claustrophobic, taut and efficient, like a streamlined car designed to simply get you there, Trespass wastes no time in setting up its premise -- and then just barrels along with an in-your-face attitude and plenty of tightly wound tension.",2.5/4
16389,Trespass,'Trespass' is a pointless movie that does nothing to further the home invasion subgenre.,2/5
16390,Trespass Against Us,Moments of excitement don't make up for what is ultimately a slow burn study of characters that aren't nearly as interesting as the movie thinks they are.,2/5
16391,Trespassers,"Hell is Where the Home is offers some nice perspectives on the home invasion genre, with some interesting character work elevating it more than others.",3/5
16392,Trial by Fire,"""Trial by Fire"" is not a feel-good movie. It's a feel-bad movie. Yet somehow, if you go in expecting that, you might enjoy it in a weird way.",3/4
16393,Trial by Jury,The most frustrating aspect of this film is how it blatantly exploits its female characters.,40/100
16394,The Trials of Henry Kissinger,"Though an important political documentary, this does not really make the case the Kissinger should be tried as a war criminal.",2.5/4
16395,Trickfilme,But what makes Trick different is that it tells a story that heterosexuals can also relate to.,72/100
16396,Trick,"Patrick Lussier's film is an incompetent, nihilistic exercise in gore and pseudophilosophy.",0/4
16397,Trick 'r Treat,"Trick 'r Treat is the film that horror fans have been waiting for - the antidote to every insipid remake, sequel and over hyped ""holy grail"" we've had to suffer through in recent years.",5/5
16398,Tricked (Steekspel),The film is experimental in the way that the final product is much more of a labor-intensive challenge for the filmmakers than a cerebral one for audiences.,1.5/4
16399,Trigger,"Shot simply but compellingly, it feels like a polished and practised portrait of rekindled bonds.",3/4
16400,The Trigger Effect,One bad idea sets off a series of more bad ideas until the film becomes unsalvageable.,1.5/4
16401,Trigger Man,"The flick's got just just as much first-half ""filler"" as it does second-half intensity, so if you're a patient genre fan, I've no problem recommending the movie.",2.5/5
16402,Triple 9,"Tight, taut and brilliantly structured.",4/5
16403,Triple Frontier,"Those that appreciate J.C. Chandor for his subtlety are going to struggle with this one, but frat boys looking for something easy to digest from Netflix on a boring night are going to have a field day with this",2/5
16404,Triple Threat,Even if it all is ridiculous I kind of loved this brutally visceral action extravaganza anyhow.,3/4
16405,Trishna,"As usual with Winterbottom's work, Trishna evokes its locations vividly; as a story with a tragic arc it's less effective.",2/5
16406,Tristana,One of Bunuel's most perverse and personal films.,5/5
16407,Tristram Shandy: A Cock & Bull Story,"It is completely nonsensical, not to mention frequently hilarious.",3/4
16408,Triumph of the Spirit,"Blinded by the fact that the story is based on a man's life, that it ""actually happened,"" the film seems to assume that the message is in the very accuracy itself. But at the end we feel confused and unsatisfied.",1/4
16409,Triumph des Willens (Triumph Of The Will),"When you leave the theater, you know you have seen the power of true evil.",4/4
16410,Trog,Not one of Crawford's finer roles.,2/5
16411,Troll 2,On par with the worst of the Krofft Brothers' productions.,1/5
16412,Trollhunter,"With all of the troll roaring, people chasing, and mythological elements, 'The Troll Hunter' is easily the 'Jurassic Park' of first-person horror.",4/5
16413,Trolls,"ntelligently devised in such a way that it's completely tongue-in-cheek and self-aware, managing to be both self-deprecating and self-referential throughout, and yet will be a huge hit amongst children who lap up the sparkly elements.",3/5
16414,Trolls World Tour,What makes Trolls World Tour more fun - and funnier - than its predecessor is the expansion of the universe and introduction of five other Troll tribes.,3.5/5
16415,Troma's War,"Starts off cleverly enough, then proceeds to badly staged low-budget war scene after badly staged low-budget war scene.",1/5
16416,TRON,There are some stolid sci-fi elements in it and some neat one-liners that'll appeal to computer users.,2.5/4
16417,Troop Beverly Hills,"Instead of being a merciless evisceration of the lifestyles of the rich, it's a little morality play in which Long transforms herself into a warm and useful person. Nobody within a mile of this project seems to have possessed an ounce of irony.",2/4
16418,Tropic of Cancer,The colors of Henry Miller's worlds coupled with his colorful expressions of desire make the experience a timeless one.,3/4
16419,Tropic Thunder,Any movie comedy that mounts such a full-frontal assault on so many fetish objects of contemporary showbiz sanctimony has earned the very wide audience Tropic Thunder will undoubtedly reach.,3.5/5
16420,Trouble Every Day (Gargoyle),"[Denis] might be off her nut, but she can sure make an interesting film, a la Davids Lynch and Cronenberg.",6/10
16421,Trouble Is My Business,... Trouble is to film noir what Once Upon a Time in the West was to the western: the final word.,4/4
16422,Trouble the Water,No unnecessary authorial pushing and prodding is required on behalf of Kim and Scott's amazing story.,3/4
16423,The Trouble with Romance,"Actorly diarrhea and writerly constipation are the frequent bane of subpar indie flicks, but in Trouble with Romance these flaws are almost instructively exacerbated, like an inverted Syd Field handbook on amateurisms to avoid.",0.5/4
16424,Trouble with the Curve,"Clint Eastwood and a superb cast hit it out of the park in Trouble With The Curve, a great entertainment filled with heart, humor, family drama and fantastic acting.",4/5
16425,Troublesome Creek: A Midwestern,The underlying lesson is clear: Our state and federal farm policies do not really allow for family farms anymore.,3/4
16426,Troy,"In a time when 'epic' has become a lazy prefix to any large-scale film, Petersen's effort truly deserves the label.",3.5/5
16427,Trucker,"Half road trip and half learning how to make a home, Trucker gives Michelle Monaghan a chance to show what she can do and the result is encouraging, although twelve year old Jimmy Bennett nearly steals the show.",7/10
16428,Trudell,Trudell belongs to a strain of documentary biopic wherein one-sided reverence is the principle impetus.,2/4
16429,True Adolescents,"While True Adolescents may be typical of its genre, it's a solid, well-made entry, with a few details (like its treatment of sexual identity) that help it stand apart from the pack.",B
16430,True Believer,"Wesley Strick gave them a good script and they made a good, solid crime mystery.",6/8
16431,True Confessions,"Quite simply it's one of the most entertaining, most intelligent and most thoroughly satisfying commercial American films in a very long time.",5/5
16432,True Grit,"certainly one of Wayne's best performances, impressive in both his creation of a larger-than-life screen presence and the nuances he gave the role in all the right places",3/4
16433,True Grit,"The versatile Joel and Ethan Coen take a major step toward mainstream (and more conventional) cinema in their enjoyable, well acted remake of the 1969 classic Western, for which John Wayne won an Oscar and Jeff Bridges should get a nomination.",B+
16434,True History of the Kelly Gang,Justin Kurzel's visual style and peculiar narrative choices (including subtle homoerotic moments) are greater than the sum of the film's parts.,B-
16435,True Identity,Charles Lane's indie feature os a goo showcase for the British comedian,B-
16436,True Legend,"Giddy wirework and occasional flurries of poor 3D don't come to the rescue of a turgid, anti-climactic plot in Yuen Woo-ping's chop-socky extravaganza...",2/5
16437,True Romance,Too often the bloodbath mentality simply washes away the film's more appealing elements.,2/4
16438,True Stories,This is not a musical. It's a bold attempt to paint a bizarre American landscape. This movie does what some painters try to do: It recasts ordinary images into strange new shapes.,3.5/4
16439,True Story,"The important themes below the surface come out in impressionistic waves. The actual story, with its occasionally cringe-worthy, on-the-nose dialogue, comes very close to exposing the entire production as a lie.",3/5
16440,The Truman Show,"A bracingly intelligent, provocative and witty mix of entertainment values and long thoughts.",4/4
16441,Trumbo,"Bryan Cranston is superb in this entertaining, insightful look at the blacklist.",8/10

16443,Trust,...Trust benefits substantially from the uniformly impressive performances...,2.5/4
16444,Trust Machine: The Story of Blockchain,"This documentary is perhaps more speculative than factual, and it's sometimes confusing or contradictory, but it offers useful, even potentially exciting, nuggets of information on blockchain.",3/5
16445,Trust Me,A small movie that offers a number of quite exciting moments.,7.5/10
16446,Trust the Man,"A romantic comedy by design, a form of torture in practice, and an atomic-strength antidote to the romantic impulse in effect.",1.5/4
16447,Truth,"As much as Truth aspires to Zodiac's heights, it lacks Fincher's cool and methodical hand, and his sublime artistry.",3/5
16448,The Truth About Cats & Dogs,"Though its romantic-comedy triangle borrows heavily from Cyrano de Bergerac, the film has more in common with Three's Company.",2.5/4
16449,The Truth About Charlie,"What happened to Demme's magic touch, and what is it with this ridiculous casting that never works?",1/4

16455,Tuck Everlasting,Its parts are infinitely better than its whole.,2/4
16456,Tucked,"An odd couple tale with a lot of heart, Tucked is a real charmer, a celebration of growing old disgracefully and a celebration of how society has changed for the better.",4/5
16457,Tucker and Dale vs. Evil,Great hillbilly horror comedy!,8/10
16458,Tucker: The Man and His Dream,"If we're offered a movie named Tucker: The Man and His Dream, we leave feeling cheated if we only get the dream.",2.5/4

16462,Tully,A little too pat for its own good.,2/4
16463,Tully,Theron looked happier driving across a post-apocalyptic desert with a car of frightened slave girls. The terrifying former high school beauty queen she played in Young Adult would glance at Marlo and sneer.,4/5

16469,Turkey Bowl,Accomplishes its small-scale goals with aplomb.,3/4
16470,Elimination Game (Turkey Shoot),The action sequences are poorly rendered and its satirical edge is blunted by its borrowings from sharper films such as Rollerball and Starship Troopers.,1/5
16471,Turn It Up,Eventually Turn It Up deteriorates into a gory shoot-'em-up gangster movie with a quick-fix ending that leaves many threads dangling. It could have been something more.,1/5

16489,Twenty Bucks,There's no deep point to be made; the device is simply an excuse to tell half a dozen short stories. But the very lightness of the premise gives the film a kind of freedom.,3/4
16490,Twenty-Four Hour Woman,Capsule Review.,2/4
16491,Twentyfourseven,"There's a certain humor in the boxing sequences (the first match turns into a brawl), and a good feeling for local color. But the personal tragedy of the Hoskins character evolves unconvincingly from the story of the boxing club.",2/4

16497,The Twilight Saga: New Moon,"This is a film for the fans. Fans of the books. Fans of the first film. If you enjoyed that, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't, you have no chance here. It's a New Moon, not a new dawn.",3.5/5

16520,Two if by Sea,[An] aimless romantic-comedy caper.,1.5/4
16521,Two Lives (Zwei Leben),The film's educational impetus is to announce to the world that even picture-perfect Norwegians continue to pay a heavy price for the horrors of WWII.,2/4
16522,Two Lovers,"An early suicide attempt, complete with potent sound design, confers a life-and-death gravity on the picture that its story about a faltering manchild with a frustrated crush doesn't fully earn.",C
16523,Two Men in Town,"There are a handful of brilliant scenes (one between Whitaker and his adoptive mother played by Ellen Burstyn stands out), however they're few and far between.",2/5

16531,Two Weeks,"An ineffective would-be tear-jerker that proves the adage 'dying is easy, comedy is hard.'",2/5
16532,Two Weeks in Another Town,The film borders on soap opera but manages to get beyond it because of Minnelli' skills as a director and the fine acting from the two male leads.,B-

16537,Tyler Perry's A Fall from Grace,"In short, it's nuts.",2/4
16538,Tyler Perry's A Madea Christmas,A hackneyed story that spoon-feeds its messages to the viewer while devising just-plain-wrong set-pieces involving a run-in with the Ku Klux Klan and the crucifixion of a bratty little white girl.,1.5/4
16539,Tyler Perry's A Madea Family Funeral,"A Madea Family Funeral gives its title character an unceremonious send-off, as amateurish and schlocky as any of the mean-but-good-hearted old lady's previous forays into the big screen.",D+
16540,Tyler Perry's Acrimony,"This endless, crushingly serious drama explores a disintegrating marriage between two shallow, selfish partners, and then, for its ridiculous third act, it turns into an awful thriller.",1/5

16564,Unaccompanied Minors,This romp just isn't funny or original enough to become a holiday classic. Although the solid cast makes it watchable.,2/5
16565,The Unbearable Lightness of Being,"What is remarkable about The Unbearable Lightness of Being, however, is not the sexual content itself, but the way Kaufman has been able to use it as an avenue for a complex story, one of nostalgia, loss, idealism and romance.",4/4
16566,The Unbelievable Truth,"What makes the film fun is the deadpan, tongue-in-cheek humor that undermines the seemingly sincere dramatic scenes.",3/4

16599,Under the Gun,"It's a tight, slick polemic which doesn't shy from the complexity surrounding the debate or the fact it wants you the viewer to get up and do something about it. With Soechtig's track record, more than a few people probably will.",4/5

16646,Universal Soldier,"I suppose there is a market for this sort of thing among bubblebrained adolescents of all ages, but it takes a good chase scene indeed to rouse me from the lethargy induced by dozens and dozens of essentially similar sequences.",2/4

16651,Unleashed,"Sweet romantic comedy-fantasy has some language, sex.",3/5
16652,Unlocked,"A serviceable thriller, until Orlando Bloom shows up as a mysterious ex-military bruiser with a Cockney accent and things go sideways, fast.",2/5
16653,Unlovable,"""Unlovable"" is a breath of fresh air and hopefully a launching pad for us to see more of DeGuzman's work. I think she has a lot more stories worth telling.",A
16654,The Unloved,"Poignant, perceptive and unrelenting, this may be bleak, like all great drama, it is ultimately uplifting as well.",4/5
16655,Unmistaken Child,"moderately engaging and fascinating, but without enough insightful and more provocative interviews, it merely scratches the surface of Tibetan reincarnation rather than delving profoundly into it.",6/10
16656,Unplanned,"A reasonably engaging story about a woman who has a crisis of conscience at her job, anchored by a strong leading performance from Ashley Bratcher.",3/4
16657,An Unreasonable Man,"An Unreasonable Man takes the story of a man usually associated with being an egomaniac, megalomaniac and even psychologically disturbed and creates a fascinating account of a man typically known just for rabblerousing two elections.",4/5

16659,The Unsinkable Molly Brown,"""Beware: The high spirits are contagious""",3/5
16660,Unstoppable,"when a few minor plot holes have the temerity to rear their ugly heads, the action is surging along relentlessly enough to make them unimportant from a purely entertainment perspective",4/5
16661,Unstrung Heroes,Unstrung Heroes has been directed by Diane Keaton with an unusual combination of sentiment and quirky eccentricity. There are moments so touching that the heart almost stops.,3.5/4

16665,(Untitled),"Studded with some funny moments, but comes off as fuzzy and false, owing to the fact that it seems conflicted about what sort of agenda to pursue, or perspective to advance.",C-

16681,Upgrade,Upgrade is a pure adrenaline shot of sci-fi body horror thrills.,4/5

16689,Urban Legend,"As interesting as the urban legend premise is, it's not enough to sustain the movie.",2/4
16690,Urban Legends: Bloody Mary,blatantly obvious that the script has nothing to do with the actual Urban Legend series,2/5
16691,Urban Legends: Final Cut,The script for Urban Legends: Final Cut was the best of 30 different takes from different combinations of writers. That's far scarier than anything in the movie.,2/10
16692,Urbanized,"Maybe this is the best title they could muster -- it's a stinker, depressing or, depending on your mood, vaguely danceable. Fortunately, the documentary itself is grand.",4/5
16693,Urge,A movie that's as empty and unlikable as the characters themselves.,1/4
16694,Urok (The Lesson),"With a steady pace and slowly rising tension, the Bulgarian drama ""The Lesson"" catalogs the minor miseries in the life of a well-meaning schoolteacher, which accumulate in a way that's both absurd and utterly realistic.",B+
16695,Us,"Us is a bit predictable and contains a few jumbled auditory edits. However, these small missteps are in the service of an ambitious story that has a lot to say about what divides us as humans and how those divisions hurt everyone.",9/10

16697,Us & Them,"Chinese romantic drama has sex, drinking, smoking.",3/5

16699,The U.S. vs. John Lennon,"In this Che Guevara t-shirt of a film, the same cliche 'them and us' shadow play that MTV and VH1 stage in everything they produce about the American 1960s is extended so excruciatingly that the era seems to occur year by year in real time.",1.5/5
16700,Use Me,"Blurring the line between fantasy and reality in ways both subtle and overt, it manages to keep you guessing right up until the end.",16/20

16707,V for Vendetta,A visual feast for the eyes and an intelligent treat for the brain.,A
16708,In the Fog,"Loznitsa knows that war exists and won't go away; rather than indulging in patriotic or pacifistic platitudes, he tries to show what it might do to our souls. And, in this writer's opinion, he succeeds.",4/5
16709,Va Savoir,Va Savoir is a relatively labored offering from Nouvelle Vague auteur Jacques Rivette.,2.5/4
16710,Vacancy,"Too bad the gifted Hungarian helmer Antal (Kontroll) makes his American debut with this sleazy thriller. Is it coincidence that the femme in this ""original"" tale is Amy, the heroine's name in the far superior Peckinpah's Straw Dogs and Mostow's Breakdown?",C
16711,Vacation,"It is a catalogue of victimization, a road map of pain, a desperate cry for help.",2.5/10
16712,Vacationland,"The film aspires to the splendor of The Living End and Totally F***ed Up, but Verow's passion and talent, unlike Gregg Araki's, is not equal to his ambition.",2/4

16719,Valerie and Her Week of Wonders,"Somehow, the constant rush of memorably striking images, all in glistening 1970s soft-focus, makes the experience a strangely watchable one.",3/5
16720,Valhalla Rising,"Bonus points for taking a wide berth around all familiar Viking stereotypes, but since the rest of the film is so alienating, dull and generally unpleasant, it's not just the characters suffering through a hellish experience.",2/5
16721,Valiant,A disarmingly enjoyable movie with a lively cast of characters and an action-packed plot based (very roughly!) on real-life events,3.5/5
16722,Valiant,Valiant is a near-perfect film that reflects the Golden Knights' first season.,9.5/10
16723,Valkyrie,"VALKYRIE feels like the exciting second part of a miniseries. Part one had all the character bits and drama, though.",7/10

16725,Valley of the Dolls,"Oh, it's a bad movie, but in a good way.",6/10
16726,Valmont,"The Frears version is cerebral and claustrophobic, an exercise in sexual mindplay. Forman's is more physical.",3.5/4
16727,Vamp,"Grace Jones is one of the great undiscovered countries of contemporary entertainment... Vamp is like all of her other movies, however. It doesn't know what to do with her.",2/4
16728,Vampira And Me,A fine tribute to a ghoulish iconoclast,3.5/5
16729,Vampire Academy,"Vampire Academy is just another failure in a long line of similarly structured experiences and quite frankly, the fact that there are six of these books blows my mind.",2/10
16730,The Vampire Bat (Blood Sucker) (Forced to Sin),Great cast and borrowed sets (from Universal) distinguish this poverty row thriller.,4/5
16731,Vampire in Brooklyn,"Murphy's performance is pretty good most of the way, but he needed a stronger director than horrormeister Wes Craven to keep him in check.",1.5/4
16732,Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant,"While it's obviously aimed at the ""tween"" crowd, we fail to see where this movie would appeal to even young viewers.",1.5/5
16733,Vampire's Kiss,Love that roach.,3/5
16734,Vampires: Los Muertos,"Vampires: Los Muertos is far more entertaining than it has any right to be, mostly due to Wallace's inventive direction and Bon Jovi's engaging lead performance.",2.5/4
16735,Vampires Suck,"Generally goes out of its way to be one of the worst, most shamelessly slapdash films of 2010. But I'm sure you already knew that.",F
16736,Vamps,A sense of anachronism is what provides the film with its melancholy heart.,3.5/4
16737,Vampyr - Der Traum des Allan Grey,"Haunting and beautiful, Dreyer's horror film is both essential viewing for vampire buffs and one of the most inscrutable yet rewarding experiences in movie history.",A

16740,Van Helsing,"Perhaps the loudest summer film of all time, Van Helsing's apt to provide more migraines than nightmares.",1/4
16741,Van Wilder: The Rise of Taj (Van Wilder 2),"Rather than pushing the envelope, the movie draws pictures of boobies on the envelope and tries to pass that off as comedy.",D-
16742,Vanilla,Just sweet enough...Kelsea Bauman is a real find.,2.5/4
16743,Vanilla Sky,A masturbatory pop culture thriller that only services Cameron Crowe's fondness for rock n' roll.,2/4
16744,Vanishing On 7th Street,"Quivering with too much CGI, an bizarrely staged opening sequence, and a lackluster ending, Vanishing ends up being ""just OK"", but that's good enough for me.",3/5
16745,Vanishing Waves,Writer/director Kristina Buozyte creates some stunning dreamscapes and puts together the shared-experience sequences with a real freshness.,2.5/4
16746,Vanity Fair,"This film, which aims to expose the banal reality behind the grande facade of high society, itself proves to have no depth.",66/100
16747,Vantage Point,A stale effort that seems content to find its niche in a harmless mediocrity.,2/5
16748,Vanya on 42nd Street,"Vanya on 42nd Street is a superior interpretation of a fantastic play, but I couldn't quite shake the conviction that I really should have seen it on 42nd Street.",7/10

16756,Velvet Buzzsaw,"Gilroy has a lot to say about money, mindless consumerism, and the soul-sucking emptiness of conflating ownership and ego-stroking with self-worth.",B
16757,Velvet Goldmine,A strange but ceaselessly fascinating barrage of music and imagery with nothing in the center to hold it all together.,2.5/4
16758,The Velveteen Rabbit,"Rabbit has a full, gushing heart it wants to share with the audience, and released in the wake of a thousand obnoxious fart-happy distractions, its inherent gentleness and ability to remain inspired by kindness is wholeheartedly welcome.",B
16759,Vendetta,Surprisingly decent.,3/5
16760,Vengeance Is Mine,"Quite literally, Imamura has created here a protagonist that's impossible to put easily to rest, and the ramifications of his examination reflect upon us all by showing how much we're willing to ignore to achieve piece of mind.",83/100

16771,"Vernon, Florida",the great turkey hunter creates a long lasting character along with the other Vernon residents,4/5

16782,Very Young Girls,Delivers less insight into the psychology of why young girls turn to prostitution than HBO's Hookers.,2/4

16794,Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"A valentine to Spain's noted city, Allen's romantic comedy isn't very deep but it's his most entertaining and commercial work since Bullets Over Broadway, a showcase for the talents of Bardem and his three femmes, Johansson, Hall and Penelope Cruz.",B+

16828,Violet & Daisy,The balance of naivete and insularly sweet exchanges are pleasing and comical but the film's painfully derivative.,2/5
16829,Violet Tendencies,"If you're paying attention, you won't be able to ignore the scattershot plotting, the synthetic emotions, the highly variable quality of the acting and the woodenness of Jesse Archer's script when it isn't dealing in one-liners.",2/5
16830,Violeta Went to Heaven,"More enjoyable as an exploration of Parra's music than her life, and well-performed by lead Francisca Gaviln.",3/5
16831,Violette,"Biopics are too often lifeless affairs, weighed down by historical plot points and never really finding their own narrative groove. Not so for Martin Provost's enthralling Violette.",4/5
16832,Viral,"The filmmakers notably doodle in the margins from the start, slightly reorienting our perspective on the familiar tropes of both the teen and apocalyptic genres, making them feel almost new again.",2.5/4
16833,The Virgin Suicides,"This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eugenides' novel marks the assured, often inspired feature film debut of writer-director Sofia Coppola.",B+
16834,Viridiana,"Viridiana has a deceptively artless quality, stemming from the poetic formality with which Bunuel allows the picture to unfold.",5/5
16835,Virtual JFK: Vietnam If Kennedy Had Lived,"Argues that nearly 60,000 United States armed forces wouldn't have lost their lives in Vietnam had John F. Kennedy not been assassinated. Duh.",2/4
16836,Virtuosity,Someone should tell Hollywood that the mass-killer genre is dead and that its virtual reality counterpart is already wheezing.,1.5/4
16837,Vision: From the Life of Hildegard von Bingen,"A soulful and spirit filled German film about the extraordinary 12th century abbess, writer, teacher, music composer, herbalist, prophet and visionary.",5/5
16838,Vision Quest,Matthew Modine's affecting performance makes the coming-of-age flick click.,3/5
16839,Visioneers,"It's a high-concept comedy, but it's down-to-earth and accessible, even a little touching.",B+
16840,Visions of 8 - The Olympics of Motion Picture Achievement,"As for so much of the rest, it seems to forget that it is the privilege of the modest art of film to find the meaning of things just in the way they are seen to be.",2/5
16841,Visitors,"Reggio's film is an artistic and aesthetic achievement unlikely to be equaled in 2013, and perhaps the only film in recent memory which can proudly claim to be unlike anything else we have ever seen.",B+
16842,Visual Acoustics: The Modernism of Julius Shulman,"Gives a convincing, contagious taste of its protagonist's playful optimism.",3/4
16843,Vita & Virginia,Don't come here for a stylised period drama that glosses over either the class gap or her mental health.,3/5
16844,Vital,"Vital offers its share of disturbing images and gristly medical-lab sound effects, but in the end, its pursuit of closure is surprisingly hopeful.",6/10
16845,Vito,"Vito Russo is a real-life hero. Vito, the documentary, tells us why.",3.5/4
16846,Viva Knievel!,Jaw-droppingly stupid.,1/5

16849,Viva Zapata!,"Throbs with a rare vitality, and a masterful picture of a nation in revolutionary torment has been got by Director Elia Kazan.",4/5
16850,Vivan las Antipodas!,Wonderfully mind blowing ... It will literally have you seeing things in a new way.,4.5/5
16851,Vivarium,The premise is set up economically and then followed up by elegant variations on the way to a satisfactory close.,4/5
16852,Vive l'Amour,An engaging mixture of bizarre wit and eroticism and heartfelt sadness.,A
16853,Voice from the Stone,Emilia Clarke gives a solid performance in this beautifully-crafted romantic horror film.,8/10
16854,Volcanoes of the Deep Sea,"As IMAX nature films go, this is one of the more absorbing ones.",2.5/4
16855,Volunteers,"No Time After Time or Star Trek 6, but you gotta love Candy.",3/5
16856,Volver,"Volver (literally, 'to return') finds Spain's favorite cinematic son Pedro Almodovar at the peak of his powers.",5/5
16857,Von Richthofen and Brown,"As a straightforward piece of WWI movie, it's not bad, but neither is it particularly exciting -- unless you just want to see the impressive footage of the cool old planes.",3.5/5
16858,Von Ryan's Express,Sinatra at his swaggering best.,81/100
16859,VooDoo,"[It's] as if everything is too detached to be interesting. In truth, the film never recovers from Ron Jeremy dancing.",3/10
16860,The Thief (Vor) (&#1042;&#1086;&#1088;),"[Stealing] the show is the eight-year-old Philipchuk, whose wide eyes register awe, puzzlement and misery with a conviction not seen since Salvatore Cascio in Cinema Paradiso.",4/5
16861,Vox Lux,Vox Lux combines social history with pop star psychodrama in a way that is both startling and highly original.,4/5
16862,Voyage of the Damned,Based on a shameful true incident that's still not forgotten.,B-
16863,Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,"Amusing, attractive, now somewhat quaint sci-fi flick.",4/5
16864,Voyeur,"The filmmakers would rather have their aged subjects talk about motivation and morality, which is ultimately far more interesting than any purportedly mind-blowing dip into the life of a man who wanted only to watch people.",B
16865,Vulgar,"Nasty, ugly, pointless and depressing, even if you hate clowns.",0/5
16866,W.,"What's most interesting about W. is that the bits cut from whole cloth are those that offer the film's titular ""protagonist"" the benefit of the doubt.",4/5
16867,W. Kamau Bell: Private School Negro,"In an era of political and social strife, Bell is the bright comedic light we all need.",8.5/10
16868,The Wackness,A great script and one of the more innovative indie comedies in recent memory.,8.5/10
16869,Waco: The Rules of Engagement,"A masterful, terribly engaging, and horribly affecting documentary.",4/5
16870,Wadjda,The mere completion of Al-Mansour's film is a towering achievement in itself; that it's also got charm and heart to spare is icing on the cake.,3.5/5
16871,Wag the Dog,"With this cast, Dog could use a much bigger bite.",2.5/4
16872,The Wages of Fear,The kind of motion picture for which commonplace phrases like 'white-knuckle tension ride' have been coined.,4/4
16873,Wagon Master,It's one of the most likable of all the Westerns directed by John Ford.,A
16874,Wagons East!,"Worst of all, the film devotes the time between gags to schmaltzing up the characters with attempts at tenderness and drama.",2/5
16875,Wah Do Dem,Slight but satisfying.,2.5/4
16876,Wah-Wah,...we've seen this sort of film countless times before...,1.5/4
16877,Waist Deep,"An embarrassing effort, at best.",3/10
16878,Wait Until Dark,"a perfect example of how mood, atmosphere, music, and direction can overcome plot weaknesses",2.5/4
16879,Waiting,"Waiting is a completely juvenile, ridiculous movie filled with frat boy humor that just happens to be very funny.",3/4
16880,Waiting For Dublin,"A better script, stronger direction and a likable star could have made Waiting for Dublin worthy of the best whimsy.",C-
16881,Waiting for Forever,An indistinct romantic-dramedy-ish something or other.,D
16882,The Waiting City,"Living up to its name, The Waiting City rewards patience. The film's initial unevenness is remedied by a captivating second half full of heart.",3.5/5
16883,Waiting for Anya,"A teenager comes of age by rescuing scores of Jews during the Holocaust, making this film an introduction to those dark years that would enlighten young viewers.",B
16884,Waiting for Armageddon,It's scary to see how many of my fellow Americans believe this stuff.,B+
16885,Waiting for Guffman,The nonstop amusing mockumentary Waiting for Guffman does to small-town acting troupes what This Is Spinal Tap did to heavy-metal bands.,3.5/4
16886,Waiting For Lightning,It's not many Americans whose names are engraved on the Great Wall of China. Daredevil Danny May certainly deserves the honor. Get stoked.,B
16887,Waiting for Superman,"Works well enough as a basic primer on how our education system got so damn broken, but also offers some hope for the future of American education.",4/5
16888,Waiting for the Barbarians,"The message is not wrong, but it certainly is a disappointing use of Guerra's talent.",C
16889,Waiting to Exhale,"You want the movie to stomp and rejoice and cry like a fool; instead it meanders and lollygags, occasionally flaring up, then sputtering again.",2/4
16890,Waitress,"Waitress is a real actor's movie, with each part written with great elan to have its own psychology and even its own dialect.",4/4
16891,Wake Wood,"The biggest surprise is not that it's hair-raising, but that it's heart-rending too.",4/5
16892,Wake in Fright,Wake in Fright remains powerful both as a portrait of a particular place at a particular time and as a potent assertion of the country's mindset.,65/100
16893,Wakefield,"The ambiguous, only partially satisfying conclusion ultimately confirms Wakefield's place as a subdued curiosity of a film...",2.5/4
16894,Waking Life,"Whether it's a product of stoic contemplation or reefer madness, Linklater's waking life becomes an elusive, one-way vehicle to God.",4/4
16895,Waking Ned Devine,One of the better cookie cutter British imports.,3/4
16896,Waking Sleeping Beauty,"The contrast between these more candid moments and those of the polished professionals is evocative, reminding us that this is a story about how the development within a corporation affects the individuals inside.",2.5/5
16897,Waking the Dead,A catatonic failure.,4/10
16898,Waking Up in Reno,Inconsequential road-and-buddy pic.,2/4
16899,Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price,"With little fanfare, Robert Greenwald has become one of the most incisive activist filmmakers in America.",A-
16900,Waldo On Weed,An uncommonly sweet documentary about a uniquely Philly character and his very special son.,3.5/5
16901,Walk Away Renee,"The catalog of horrors occasionally feels incomplete (who's holding the camera in the most intimate scenes?), but the movie does an exceptional job of expanding on its narrow focus.",3/4
16902,"Walk, Don't Run",Tepid remake of The More the Merrier makes an unassuming swan song for Cary Grant.,3/5
16903,Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story,"The pugnacious John C. is gifted and knows no bounds. Walking hard, for him... effortless.",4/5
16904,A Walk in the Clouds,"A Walk in the Clouds is a glorious romantic fantasy, aflame with passion and bittersweet longing.",4/4
16905,Walk Of Shame,"Though replete with plot holes and lapses in logic as wide and ugly as the L.A. Freeway, Walk of Shame doesn't have the moxie to go anywhere ludicrous or dangerous with its premise.",D
16906,A Walk on the Moon,Unmistakably feels like a rough cut of a possibly good movie.,2/4
16907,Walk on Water,"In Eytan Fox's Walk on Water, the Sea of Galilee is paved with good intentions.",2/4
16908,Walk the Line,"Though conventional and burdened with showbiz cliches, this is Mangold's most commercial and enjoyable film, with good Phoenix as Cash and brilliant Witherspoon as June Carter",B
16909,A Walk to Remember,An awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers.,44/100
16910,Walk With Me,"The film's great merit is that it shares the difficulty of reaching its goal: nothing more difficult than to endure one's own silences, like those of a documentary with images of individual and collective meditation. [Full review in Spanish]",3.5/5
16911,Walkabout,Roeg intercuts images of modern life with the lushness of nature -- offering a stunning fable about the importance of respecting the earth.,3/4
16912,Walking and Talking,"Other than being a pleasant and enjoyable film, it doesn't really have much to say about relationships.",C+
16913,Walking on Sunshine,"If you threw a camera, boom mic and clapper board into the monkey enclosure at the zoo they'd have produced something more worthwhile than Walking On Sunshine.",2/10
16914,Walking Out,A father and son are faced with a harrowing test of endurance in this snowy thriller with a burning heart.,5/5
16915,Walking Tall,It's a shame Bray didn't insist the writers cut out some of the extraneous plot and tie together the fight scenes a little better.,2.5/5
16916,Walking With Dinosaurs,"With an insulting and lacklustre paint-by-numbers story, Walking with Dinosaurs comes across more as a shameless Christmas cash grab by studio execs advertising dinosaur toys rather than an actual film.",2/10
16917,Walking With The Enemy,"[Director] Schmidt thinks he has a 'Doctor Zhivago' epic on his hands, but the presentation is sub-History Channel.",2/5
16918,WALL-E,"The film poses as thinking-fans animation, but there's little room for wonder or interpretation in the on-the-nose presentation.",2.5/4
16919,Wall Street,"Wall Street, in large part due to the timing of its release, became more than just a movie. It became a declaration of the moral bankruptcy infiltrating elements of society, and Gekko's words were an ode to that philosophy.",3/4
16920,Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"It may have taken 23 years, but it was well worth the wait. Wall Street 2 is a proper return to form for Stone and Douglas, and comes just at the right time to tell its story. Gordon Gekko is back.",4/5
16921,Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit,"The biggest treat! Plasticine or not, Wallace & Gromit are two of the most entertaining and instantly likeable characters to grace a family film in quite some time",3.5/5
16922,Walt & El Grupo,"This historical film has to be seen for the glorious way it takes you back through time, making you feel as if you are part of Disney's entourage.",9.5/10
16923,Walt Before Mickey,"Watered-down ""young Disney"" biopic is too bland to appeal.",2/5
16924,Walter,more an extended situation than an actual story,6/10
16925,Waltz with Bashir,Eerily beautiful.,3.5/4
16926,Wanda,"Wanda is rather out of step with the other, more famous, lovers-on-the-run films of its period.",73/100
16927,Wanda Sykes: I'ma Be Me,"[Wanda] Sykes's concert act both provokes and stimulates, but nonetheless leaves much to be desired.",2.5/5
16928,Wanda Sykes: Not Normal,"Sykes manages to balance the personal and the political in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed, even if comedians commenting on Trump has now become de rigueur.",4/5
16929,Wanderlust,A hidden comedy gem that will appeal as much to fans of Wain and Rudd's earlier work together as those who just enjoy good raunchy laughs.,7.5/10
16930,Wanted: Dead or Alive,There are times during the movie when the greatest mystery is whether or not Rutger Hauer is trying to speak with an American accent.,1.5/4
16931,War (Rogue Assassin),The fatal flaw of War ... is that I don't give two craps about anyone in it.,D+
16932,War and Peace,Spectacle galore starring Hepburn and Fonda.,3/5
16933,War Dogs,"War Dogs is a ""rags""-to-riches story about two white dude-bro arms dealers who lie, cheat, and steal their way into U.S. Military contracts. It's vacuous, ugly, unfunny, and, somehow, not a satire. It might be the worst movie of the year.",D-
16934,War for the Planet of the Apes,"Although War can be seen as a larger parable about the shortcomings of the human race, in the short term, it's a powerful reflection of America in decline.",5/5
16935,War Horse,You certainly can't accuse Spielberg and his screenwriter collaborators Richard Curtis and Lee Hall of not trying.,3/5
16936,"War, Inc.",The ongoing corporatization of war is definitely ripe for satire of Catch-22 calibre. One hopes others will rise to the bait and hit the target dead centre.,2.5/5
16937,War Machine,"Should be equally very funny and maddening for pro-Obama and anti-Obama audiences, pro-war and anti-war audiences. War Machine is about the global machinations of work and how stop-and-start and counterproductive so many of our occupations have become.",3.5/5
16938,War Made Easy,"War Made Easy is an engrossing bit of finger-pointing, ushering in another fascinating shade to the world's current woes, not to mention a devastating portrait of fallacy that grows stronger by the gunshot.",B
16939,"War of the Arrows (Arrow, The Ultimate Weapon)",Combines the visual splendour and historical drama of Takashi Miike's 13 Assassins with the unrelenting second-half intensity of Mel Gibson's Apocalypto.,4/5
16940,The War of the Roses,"Something so heinous, you have to watch it.",3/5
16941,War of the Worlds,...everything you'd look for in a summer blockbuster and more!,8/10
16942,War of the Worlds: Goliath,"Cleverly, the animators rattle the frame on the tripods' exteriors to suggest the machines' Earth-shaking mass. That's pretty much the inventory of the film's ""+"" column.",2.5/5
16943,War on Everyone,"There's fun to be had in the shtick, but the point? It's missing, presumed dead.",2/5
16944,War on Whistleblowers: Free Press and the National Security State,Whistle-blowers become effective when their information appears in a news outlet's reliably sober columns - not in a bar mitzvah video.,2/5
16945,War Requiem,The rhythm of the images attunes the viewer to the music's components.,3/5
16946,The War Room,"At the very least, it may dispel the notion that campaign managers pervert the course of democracy with behind-the-scenes omniscience; the surprise in the film is that they're often as confused as their candidates sometimes seem to be.",3.5/4
16947,War Room,"A prayer-ordained, Prodigal husband parable preaching primarily to the choir!",2/4
16948,War Story,"Jackson is wise to keep Keener's pushy, desperate Lee in centre focus.",3/5
16949,The War Tapes,"A true original, the first look at the U.S.-Iraq war from cameras embedded with the soldiers in the field.",B+
16950,The War Wagon,"Lame, late-in-the-day Wayne actioner.",2/5
16951,War Witch,...an intriguing and frequently disturbing drama that tells an important story in an impressively even-handed way...,3/4
16952,Warcraft,"Warcraft provides thunderous spectacle, but when performing the alchemy of transforming genre archetypes into characters with soul, the magic fizzles out.",C
16953,WarGames (War Games),Exciting and well-paced.,3/4
16954,Warlock,Richard E. Grant singlehandedly makes it worthwhile,4/5
16955,Warlords (Tau ming chong),Peter Chan's period epic features some spectacular battle sequences and a strong performance from Jet Li but it drags considerably in the middle section and it's hard to really engage with the story.,3/5
16956,Warm Bodies,"It's hard to beat a brain-eating scene with John Waits' ""Missing You"" blaring in the background, the '80s ode to the forlorn has never sounded so grotesquely poignant.",A-
16957,Warm Water Under a Red Bridge (Akai Hashi No Shita Noo Nurui Mizu),"There's ... tremendous energy from the cast, a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate.",4/5
16958,Warning Sign,Warning Sign takes what should have been an exciting subject (ie Outbreak) and turns it into an excrutiatingly dull one (ie The Andromeda Strain).,1.5/4
16959,Warrior King 2 (The Protector 2),CGI Jaa? Say it ain't so.,3.5/10
16960,Warriors of Heaven and Earth (Tian di ying xiong),"Despite the breathtaking locales, Warriors of Heaven and Earth is impossibly cheesy.",1.5/4
16961,Warriors of the Rainbow: Seediq Bale,"There's something to be said about a two-and-a-half-hour war epic that manages to make each of its countless decapitation scenes feel earned, even called for, in the moment.",3/4
16962,Wasabi,"[Tries] to parody a genre that's already a joke in the United States. The movie is the equivalent of French hip-hop, which also seems to play on a 10-year delay.",2/5
16963,Washington Square,"Leigh may sound like a peculiar casting choice for a costume drama, but her trademark mannerisms and mumbly elocution are a perfect fit.",3/4
16964,Wassup Rockers,"Clark remains a compelling, primal anthropologist--but there are only so many times you can applaud a one-trick pony",2.5/4
16965,Waste Land,"Finally! Proof that art is garbage, garbage is art.",B+
16966,Wasted on the Young,"Without question one of the most striking Australian films of the past five years, director Lucas stamps his visual style on a very contemporary - and at times very confronting - teen revenge story.",4/5
16967,Wasted! The Story of Food Waste,Surprisingly appetizing and funny...for a movie that harangues us for throwing out edible food.,3/4
16968,Watch List,"This ""fictional"" look at Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's ""War on Drugs"" is a searing indictment of how the innocent get swept up in unbelievable tragedies, copious deaths, and no end in sight to the real problem.",4/4
16969,Watch on the Rhine,"A fine, sincere, outspoken film.",4.5/5
16970,The Watcher,"The Watcher isn't that hard to watch, but you could find better things to do with your eyes.",2/4
16971,Watchers of the Sky,Social justice is a hard and often nebulous concept to depict in a documentary Belzberg actually revels in the elevated aspects of the discussion.,B+
16972,Watchmen,It's the Watchmen movie you always wanted to see but never expected to get.,5/5
16973,Water,Mehta's conventional direction fails to do proper justice to this disturbing reality.,2.5/5
16974,Water for Elephants,...one of the best films I've seen this year.,5/5
16975,The Water Horse: Legend of the Deep,"The star of this Scottish fable, about the mythical Loch Ness monster, looks like a raw chicken breast with teeth when he hatches.",C-
16976,The Waterboy,The story is really just a flimsy premise for a series of gags.,57/100
16977,Waterland,"Gyllenhaal refers to Waterland as ""a world of the mind."" and it is an experience definitely worth exploring.",4/5
16978,Waterloo Bridge,"Glossy, sanitized remake of the brilliant 1931 James Whale film",3/5
16979,Watermark,"It's meant to inspire us to think about our relationship with water and how we use it, and in this it succeeds admirably.",2.5/4
16980,Watership Down,A dark and transfixing fable that happens to star cartoon bunnies.,5/5
16981,Waterworld,"Waterworld is a marginal film: always extravagant, sometimes entertaining, often preachy and dull -- a pure formula picture.",2/5
16982,Wattstax,"The director, Mel Stuart, cuts from performance sequences to encounter-group dialogues with Watts residents to clips of Richard Pryor improvising at a local bar, the ferocity of his wit bubbling up from the rage of his persecution.",B
16983,Waves,"With remnants of Moonlight, Luce, and American Honey sprinkled throughout, Trey Edward Shults pays tribute to great independent films and filmmakers while also bringing to life an unforgettable story of his own...",10/10
16984,Waxwork II: Lost in Time,"Evil Dead 2 meets, well ... something really rotten.",2/5
16985,Way Down East,The movie is today noted chiefly for its legendary climactic episode: a harrowingly realistic sequence in which the hero hurdles a succession of floating ice blocks to save the heroine from being washed over the falls.,3/5
16986,The Way Home (Jibeuro),Do we really need another film that praises female self-sacrifice?,1.5/5
16987,The Way of the Gun,"A threepenny opera of lurid plot turns, oceanic bloodletting, and pseudo-existential dialogue.",3/10
16988,The Way We Were,Comes off as about as believable as a love affair between myself and a potted plant.,2/5
16989,Wayne,"Apart from the title, I loved every minute of Jeremy Sims' surprising and entertaining film.",4/5
16990,Wayne's World,"Like the Bill & Ted movies, this one works on its intended level and then sneaks in excursions to some other levels, too.",3/4
16991,Wayne's World 2,"[The] same concepts that looked refreshing and entertaining two years earlier, seem boring and repetitive now.",4/10
16992,Ways To Live Forever,"A wise, heartwarming, uplifting and inspiring coming-of-age film for the entire family. You'll laugh, you'll cry. It's one of the best films of year.",10/10
16993,W.E.,"What an extraordinarily silly, preening, fatally mishandled film this is.",1/5
16994,We Are Boats,"Developing a complicated and layered story could be overwhelming, but Bird's vision carefully and thoughtfully delves deeply into life with magnetic characters all of whom we can relate on some level",3.5/4
16995,We Are Little Zombies,"Writer/director/composer Makoto Nagahisa is the mad scientist behind this concoction, which plays out like someone plugged a fever dream directly into a console video system, and then set it on fire.",7/10
16996,We Are Marshall,The effort of building a new team and the results will warm the hearts of football fans everywhere.,3.5/5
16997,We Are Still Here,"We Are Still Here is more or less a 90-minute tribute to the superior haunted house features that came before. Great poster, though.",D+
16998,We Are the Best!,"Sly, fun and irresistible.",4/5
16999,We Are the Heat,"We Are The Heat is a grand new addition to the pantheon of black-lead gangster movies, the evolution of dancing on film, and a badge of honor for the Afro-Latin people of Colombia that they should be proud to showcase to the world.",4/5
17000,We Are The Night,"As vampire movies go, it's a damn sight better than Twilight.",2.5/4
17001,We Are Together: The Children of Agape Choir,"There are moments of joy, so sublime you feel your heart swell with the sound of the children's voices and segments of sadness as sharp as a scalpel.",4/5
17002,We Are Twisted F***ing Sister!,"Perhaps ""We are Twisted F***ing Sister"" doesn't satisfy in the expected manner, but it's a terrific summary of hard work and dedication to a dream, presenting casual fans with a PhD in SMF-ology.",B+
17003,We Are What We Are,"We Are What We Are is a film that ought to feel like an amusement park terror ride, but instead comes off as a poor attempt at fine art.",4.3/10
17004,We are Wizards,"Is this just a sub-pop-culture phenomena, or is this fan hood at its best?",B
17005,We Are X,"Sundance really knows their music docs, and We Are X is possibly the greatest music doc to come out of the festival since Searching For Sugarman in 2014.",5/5
17006,We Are Your Friends,"Injects a throbbing beat and fresh style into a classic coming-of-age tale, but all the electronic dance music and formal experimentation can't keep it out of the mire of a well-worn narrative.",2.5/4
17007,We Believe In Dinosaurs,"Brown and Ross smartly bring in local church leaders, who have equally grave concerns about the museum and its problematic existence. Films like this serve as a mirror to Christians to show just how the world sees our actions.",7.5/10
17008,We Bought a Zoo,Crowe finds just the right blend of easy crowd-pleasing moments while maintaining the strong sense of drama and character dynamics in which he excels.,7.5/10

17011,We Go On,"It never quite pulls together, never quite chills as it could do, but overall is a decent film that has ambition and is an agreeable enough way to spend an hour and a half.",6/10
17012,We Have a Pope,"Habemus Papam wants to emphasise the human consequences of a great religious office, and in that it succeeds. But Moretti's narrative construction lets him, and his film, down.",3/5

17014,We Own the Night,"It's a solid, if unremarkable piece of storytelling.",3/5
17015,We Steal Secrets: The Story Of Wikileaks,"Truth is an endangered species in this war, but Gibney's thoughtful movie suggests Manning might be its greatest casualty.",3/5
17016,We Summon the Darkness,"It also hinges on a big plot twist, so all I will say for now is that it's the best Satanic Panic-inspired horror movie I have seen this year, and there have been several.",B
17017,We the Animals,"In every scene, We the Animals evokes not only the specificity of that world but the deep-seated challenges of escaping it.",A-
17018,We the Parents,"""We the Parents,"" one-sided and promotional as it often feels, presents a possible solution, as well as the difficulties in achieving it.",2.5/4
17019,We the Party,"While We the Party can be insensitive, or blind, to the misogyny and homophobia of the general culture (the token gay teen is a finger-snapping, head-bobbing fashionista), it takes the issues of race and class quite seriously.",3/4
17020,We The People: The Market Basket Effect,"The filmmakers have made this for the purposes of near-term celebration rather than long-term understanding, and they're probably judging their audience well.",2.5/4

17022,We Were Soldiers,Wallace's emotional message and refreshingly non-demonised enemy make an effective tribute.,3/5
17023,The Weather Man,The metaphor is a low pressure zone of poor and overstrained choices. the weather pattern battered by winds of exaggeration.,3/5
17024,Web Junkie,"Web Junkie is a little sad, a little funny and a little scary. I'd say that I wish it had been a little more provocative, but I'm sure conversations after screenings will serve some of that purpose and those are conversations worth having.",B
17025,The Wedding Banquet (Xi yan),The Wedding Banquet never becomes bogged down by its own seriousness. Lee manages to keep the production buoyant by including scenes that are often riotously funny.,3/4
17026,Wedding Crashers,"Enjoyably silly but far too long, this buddy rom-com has sharp enough characters and a witty script that keeps us laughing when it wants to.",3/5
17027,The Wedding Date,"Some films are ripped from the headlines, others are ripped from the pages of Cosmopolitan.",1/4
17028,Wedding Palace,"While the story is a bit weak, the film does a good job of contrasting Korean-Americans who steadfastly adhere to the traditions of their homeland with South Koreans who have renounced old customs.",3/5

17030,The Wedding Singer,"In essence, The Wedding Singer is a K-Tel hits package posing as a movie.",B-
17031,Weekend,"Well-written and insightful, I don't think we've seen a gay-themed film this purely romantic and ultimately affecting since ""Brokeback Mountain."" One of the five best GLBT-themed narrative films of 2011.",B+
17032,Weekend at Bernie's,"Weekend at Bernie's makes two mistakes: It gives us a joke that isn't very funny, and it expects the joke to carry an entire movie.",1/4
17033,Weekend at Bernie's II,"Let's just hope that this projected series of films (and I use the term loosely) dies a quiet, unremarked-upon death unlike that of its title character.",0/5
17034,Weekend Of A Champion,"I wonder if there isn't something a little bit placid and self-satisfied about the film, which is paced remarkably slowly, given the subject matter.",3/5

17045,Welcome to Marwen,"Despite a sympathetic lead performance from Steve Carell, the fictionalized version bogs down in extensive animated doll sequences, so similar they grow increasingly tiresome.",2/4
17046,Welcome to Me,"In ""Welcome to Me"" we are spoiled by the comedic capabilities of Kristen Wiig, an expert doing what she does best. We wouldn't really want it any other way.",B

17049,Welcome To New York,I watched the whole thing with my jaw on the floor.,4/5
17050,Welcome to Sarajevo,Welcome to Sarajevo isn't just the story of an outsider's perspective of the conflict; it's a compelling examination of the role the media played in reporting and shaping the average person's views of the war.,3.5/4
17051,Welcome to the Dollhouse,"There's not much of a defined plot to Welcome to the Dollhouse, just a series of encounters as Dawn writhes about under torture. Yet, it is a well done film.",2.5/4
17052,Welcome to the Jungle,"Welcome To The Jungle strands audiences on a deserted island without food, shelter, or any real form of entertainment - a fate not even action-star-turned-comedian Jean-Claude Van Damme can save us from.",4/10
17053,Welcome to the Punch,That Creevy has talent isn't in question; whether this substanceless stuff is the best outlet for it is another matter.,3/5
17054,Welcome to the Rileys,"While it's not among the best films I saw at Sundance, it's still quite entertaining, and well worth seeing",7.5/10

17056,Welcome to Woop Woop,"Has to be seen to be believed, but I don't recommend it.",0/5
17057,We'll Never Have Paris,Too often the flat-lining jokes and botched attempts at emotional sincerity merely enhance the character's pathological nature instead of offsetting it.,2/5
17058,Wendigo,Fessenden's narrative is just as much about the ownership and redefinition of myth as it is about a domestic unit finding their way to joy.,3/4
17059,Wendy and Lucy,"Decency is heartbreakingly trampled by strict, hard-nosed, boot-straps logic and the kind of hippie freedom nostalgia of movies like Easy Rider is quietly blown away like dust.",5/5
17060,Went the Day Well?,"Fortunately, it's of more than mere historical interest thanks to some well-paced action, enthusiastic acting and the influence of Graham Greene's dark imagination.",5/5
17061,Went to Coney Island on a Mission From God...Be Back by Five,"Too much of the film seemed to have no place to go, just like the misinformed tourists who go to Coney in the winter and find that the Cyclone ride is not in service.",C
17062,We're Back! A Dinosaur's Story,"We're Back is an exercise in endurance -- not only is it dull, but it has such an overwhelming sense of sweetness that it threatens to become nauseating.",2/4
17063,We're The Millers,I'm baffled how you can throw this many relatively funny people at an idea this blatantly down-the-middle and end up with something like this.,D
17064,Were the World Mine,"The movie takes the familiar scenarios of high school angst and adolescent crushes and gives them a wonderful musical spin, complete with elaborate sets and choreography.",2.5/4
17065,Werewolf of London,"A horror film that would have been better with someone else in the lead. Still, it's a classic.",3/5
17066,Werewolf: The Beast Among Us,"Werewolf: The Beast Among Us is hardly the disaster many feared, but its not very good, either.",4.5/10
17067,Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls,Worthless and non-sensical remake of a true horror classic.,1/5
17068,Wes Craven Presents Dracula III: Legacy,"...contains some decent acting and some solid atmospherics. The only thing it doesn't contain is a script adequate enough to develop any serious thrills, shocks, or suspense.",5/10
17069,Wes Craven's New Nightmare,"I haven't been exactly a fan of the Nightmare series, but I found this movie, with its unsettling questions about the effect of horror on those who create it, strangely intriguing.",3/4
17070,West of Memphis,"""West Of Memphis"" brings enough to the table to stand alongside ""Paradise Lost"" as a nuanced, powerful look at a miscarriage of justice...",A
17071,West Side Story,Demonstrates yet again the enduring quality of Shakespeare's work.,9/10
17072,Western,"Brilliant exponent of the Berlin School, Grisebach tackles a masculine universe without falling into the truisms or the thick stroke. [Full review in Spanish]",4/5

17074,Westworld,"If you like science fiction, you will probably enjoy seeing the movie. Be prepared however to be frustrated by its low energy level.",2.5/4
17075,Wet Hot American Summer,"There are spatters of truly dark and bizarre comedy throughout, which gives an indication that the film will take off in an original direction, but as the film wears on it drifts closer and closer to the same old same old.",2/5

17077,Wetlands Preserved: The Story of an Activist Rock Club,A heartfelt tribute to a joyous anomaly in New York's nightlife scene.,3/5
17078,Whale Rider,An exquisite film that sensitively captures the noble spirit of [the New Zealanders] -- and their humor.,4/5
17079,Whaledreamers,The September 11 segment is one of the clumsiest works of montage you're likely to see.,1.5/4
17080,The Whales of August,"Here is a quiet film of a conventional story, a star vehicle designed to show everyone to advantage.",3/4
17081,What a Girl Wants,"It's slick girlie stuff, but the cast makes it go down easy.",2/4
17082,What a Way to Go!,An unappealing episodic black comedy that gets stuck in its own silliness.,C
17083,What About Bob?,This is an amiable comedy if there ever was one. That's no criticism: if all innocuous comedies were as satisfying as What About Bob? you wouldn't always feels the need for some subversive humor.,3/5
17084,What Alice Found,[A] refreshing road movie.,3.5/5

17086,"What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?",Tasteless shambles of a comedy.,2/5
17087,What Doesn't Kill You,"The story is generic and uncompelling, coming across as just another gritty drama about a major city's criminal underbelly.",C+
17088,What Dreams May Come,"Vincent Ward taps into the very core of romantic yearning, coming up with an admittedly sappy but no less poignant tale of true, pure love.",3.5/4
17089,What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?,It's a film that's a little slow to start and could benefit from a faster pace. But this is still essential viewing with the superb Davis in legend mode and Crawford wisely under-playing her role as the victim.,4/5
17090,"What Happened, Miss Simone?","What Happened, Miss Simone? is another example of Wikipedia-entry-as-cinema, but with a life this remarkable, it's still worth a look.",3/5
17091,What Happened to Monday,[Noomi Rapace] manages to turn a derivative sci-fi movie into something slightly more exciting.,C

17093,What Have I Done to Deserve This? (Qu he hecho yo para merecer esto!!),A somewhat harsh critique of a Spanish culture that dooms women to indentured servitude.,B+
17094,What If...,"Ultimately, What If . . . fails before it hits the 10-minute mark.",2.5/4
17095,What If,Elevated from an above-average romantic comedy to a movie worthy of being embraced by a generation of twenty somethings because it refuses to let its characters off the hook.,7.2/10
17096,What Just Happened?,"A minor, too gentle satire about Hollywood, Levinson'insider's film adds a panel to a growing body of films--really a subgenre--including his own Wag the Dog and Jimmy Hollywood, but lacks originality and biting humor.",C+
17097,What Keeps You Alive,Anderson and Allen ... deliver two beautifully complicated depictions of women driven by very different emotions.,4/5
17098,What Lies Beneath,"A decent popcorn movie for adults, but not much lies beneath",B-

17100,What Maisie Knew,This modern-day adaptation of Henry James's novel about a child shuttled back and forth between her divorced parents features an excellent performance from newcomer Onata Aprile.,4/5
17101,What Men Want,"This movie relies completely on Henson, cutting loose as a woman who's both on top and bugging out uncontrollably. She's a riot with broad comedy...",3/5
17102,What Our Fathers Did: A Nazi Legacy,The conclusion suggests the film exists to affirm the preconceived desires and perceptions of its makers.,2/4
17103,What Richard Did,What Richard Did inevitably does reach a point at which the uneventfulness starts to become a little oppressive...,2/4
17104,What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael,A no-brainer for film buffs.,3/4
17105,What Still Remains,Josh Mendoza's post-apocalyptic drama What Still Remains taps into the same dystopian elements that helped to heighten the likes of The Hunger Games franchise and The Road.,8/10
17106,What the Bleep Do We Know!?,Here's the mystery for me. How did questions that started out so vast and existential swirl down into something so small and loopy and pathetic?,0.5/4
17107,What They Had,A well-acted yet erratic drama,2.5/4
17108,What to Expect When You're Expecting,"At least a slight step up from director Kirk Jones's last effort, 2009's claw-your-eyes-out-awful Robert De Niro vehicle Everybody's Fine.",2/5
17109,What We Did on Our Holiday,"I can't quite believe that a film as cheesy-looking as What We Did On Our Holiday is this good, but it is. It really is.",8/10
17110,What We Do In The Shadows,"It shouldn't work as well as it does, but funny is funny, and this one had me cracking up often...",3.5/5
17111,What We Do Is Secret,"Hits quick, hits hard and never lets go.",A
17112,What We Found,The quality of the film seems to replicate that roller coaster reality. Often it is engaging then the next moment it is a little flat with some uneven acting.,3/5
17113,What Women Want,A film with a truly fascinating and clever premise that nevertheless collapses under the weight of everything that surrounds the central storyline.,2/4
17114,What You Gonna Do When the World's on Fire?,Cinematographer Diego Romero Suarez-Llanos shoots everything with an unobtrusive beauty and Minervini is once more incredibly adept at making these slices of life cohere into both individual stories and in order to present a broader panorama. The,5/5
17115,Whatever Works,The Woodman's return to New York after a four-year European sojourn finds him working very familiar territory much less fruitfully than in the past.,2/4
17116,What's Cooking?,"If the story is banal, the dialogue lacking in sharpness, and the exposition taking forever before Chadha cuts to the chase, the well-acted film is a love poem to the city of angels.",7/10
17117,What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"First, the good part. There is a 20 second clip of an architecturally interesting courthouse. The rest of the show is either boring or unbearably depressing.",0.5/4
17118,What's In A Name?,"If I found any one of these five relatable, I wouldn't be wondering what to call my son, but rather inquiring into an operation that would make procreation an impossibility.",1.5/5

17120,"What's New, Pussycat?",Somewhere in the proceedings there were sane and skillful artisans at work.,2/5
17121,What's the Matter with Kansas?,"Every single person in this film is seen as themselves, is allowed to speak and seems to have a good heart. I've rarely seen a documentary quite like it. It has a point to make but no ax to grind.",3.5/4
17122,What's the Worst That Could Happen?,"This, that's what.",1.5/4
17123,"What's Up, Doc?",Bogdanovich's slapstick tribute lives up to its inspiration.,4/5
17124,What's Your Number?,Two charming leads don't make up for a comedy that just doesn't quite deliver the laughs it should.,2/5
17125,Wheelman,A unique perspective wasted on a film that fails to deliver any actual excitement.,5/10
17126,When a Man Loves a Woman,Here is a wise and ambitious film about the way alcoholism affects the fabric of a marriage.,4/4
17127,When a Stranger Calls,"some of the cast is so bad it made me wonder if they won some sort of internet contest, or were the fifth caller on a radio station to get their roles",1.5/4
17128,When a Stranger Calls Back,As ineffective as its erratic predecessor...,1.5/4
17129,When Comedy Went to School,A humorous look at Borscht Belt comedians during the Golden Age of American Comedy.,B+
17130,When Did You Last See Your Father?,"While it's beautifully shot and acted, the film is also somewhat indulgent and meandering.",3/5
17131,When Harry Met Sally,"When Harry Met Sally . . . is an adult romantic comedy in a time when we don't get very many, and it has one thing going for it that gives it an enormous boost -- it's very funny.",3.5/4
17132,When Harry Tries to Marry,"The larger problems are the usual ones for low-budget romcoms: haphazard plotting, clumsily staged and overly broad comedy and clunky dialogue.",1.5/5
17133,When I Saw You,"Like Antoine Doinel in The 400 Blows, Tarek has a way of using defiance and sarcasm to make himself seem smarter than any ostensible authority figure.",3/4
17134,When I Walk,"The resulting collage of home movies leaves its audience, like its subject, not quite sure what to make of it all.",3/5
17135,When in Rome,"This movie is a waste of talent, effort and most of all time, and why anyone with half a brain would willingly choose to subject themselves to viewing it is light years beyond me.",0/4
17136,When Jews Were Funny,"On the whole, I think When Jews Were Funny is a strong testament to a lost age, a kind of elegy to the self-deprecation and introspection that certainly shaped in a major way modern comedy.",B-
17137,When Marnie Was There,"Like many Ghibli films, its central characters are female, its story a mixture of the quotidian and the remarkable.",3.5/5
17138,When Night Is Falling,"Rozema is a fabulist with a strong visual sense, and she creates a distinctive, enclosed world to illustrate Camille's odyssey.",3/4
17139,When the Bough Breaks,"The plot doesn't differ much from last year's parody of these types of movies, A Deadly Adoption ...",C+
17140,When the Dragon Swallowed the Sun,"The staggering landscapes of this mountainous land are captured beautifully as director Dirk Simon picks apart contradictions within Tibetan society. Philip Glass, Thom Yorke and Damien Rice provide terrific musical accompaniment.",3/5
17141,When The Game Stands Tall,"Too often, the story falls prey to strained melodrama, such as when a star running back (Alexander Ludwig) confronts his trophy-seeking father (Clancy Brown).",2/4
17142,When the Levees Broke: A Requiem in Four Acts,"What breaks your heart is the film's accumulated firsthand stories of New Orleans residents who lost everything in the flood after Hurricane Katrina, and the dismaying conclusion that a year after the disaster, the broken city has been largely abandoned.",4/5
17143,When Time Ran Out,"With cheesy special effects (even the volcano isn't convincing, considering the film cost $20 million) and a hole-ridden script, this film offers precious little to like.",0/4
17144,When We First Met,"So-so time-travel romcom has swearing, drinking.",2/5
17145,When Will I Be Loved,"Were it not for Campbell's classy magnetism in the role, the crass motivations behind this episodic pastiche would be easier to reject.",2.5/5
17146,When Worlds Collide,The bottom of the barrel of disaster movies,1.5/5

17148,Where Angels Fear to Tread,"Where Angels Fear to Tread was released in England last summer, and has the misfortune to open here just before Howards End, one of the year's best films. If you have time to see only one Forster this year, Angels is not the one.",2/4

17150,Where Eagles Dare,Non-stop action of the highest quality.,4/5
17151,Where God Left His Shoes,This film needs more than God's Nikes to resonate with an already economically downtrodden filmgoing populace.,2/6
17152,Where Hands Touch,"Simplistic, saccharine script + the absurdity of everyone's speaking English. Even on Amazon Prime episodes like ""Jack Ryan,"" the Arabs speak Arabic.",C+
17153,Where Hope Grows,"Well-intentioned but corny and illogically old-fashioned faith-based melodrama about a bitter ex-ballplayer and his new pal, a boy with Down Syndrome.",1.5/4
17154,Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?,Dependent on a gimmick which is feels like a death sentence Spurlock spends the entire movie trying to dodge.,2.5/5
17155,Where Is Kyra?,"Starring an against-type and utterly fascinating Michelle Pfeiffer as the titular Kyra, the film narrows in on the tragedy of getting old in America.",B+
17156,Where the Buffalo Roam,Funny but campy rendition of Hunter S. Thompson by Bill Murray. Easier to watch than FEAR AND LOATHING,4/5
17157,Where the Day Takes You,"The movie, which was shot on and around Hollywood Boulevard, shows a side of runaway kids we haven't seen before: how they form surrogate families in the streets, seeking reassurance and security that they never felt at home.",3/4

17159,Where the Money Is,"Sadly, the subtext and context of Money is that everyone's better days are a distant memory.",3/5
17160,Where the Sidewalk Ends,A fascinating brutish and dark film noir that is set in the corrupt milieu of the underworld.,B+
17161,Where the Truth Lies,"Cerebral art director Atom Egoyan excels at making small, personal films. But Where the Truth Lies proves again that he is not a commercial or genre director.",C+

17163,Where to Invade Next,"Where to Invade Next preaches entertainingly to its choir, but offers little in the way of actionable intelligence.",6/10
17164,"Where'd You Go, Bernadette",It's a safe movie about people who don't feel safe in this world.,3.5/5
17165,Where's Daddy?,"A must-see expose' suggesting justice ain't blind, but rather inclined to dispense a color-coded brand of justice when it comes to child support.",4/4
17166,Where's Marlowe?,If it had a livelier pace and more believable acting by secondary characters ... Where's Marlowe? would be a big treat for audiences seeking a hip comedy.,2/4
17167,Where's My Roy Cohn?,"What's remarkable about ""Where's My Roy Cohn?"" - besides the title, taken from a quote from Trump in the White House - is that Tyrnauer manages not to humanize or make us empathize with Cohn.",3.5/4

17177,Whirlpool,There is no doubt that people will do strange things under hypnotic spell and that the techniques of hypnotism may be villainously employed. But you don't catch this fairly rational corner believing for one minute the hocuspocus that goes on.,2/5
17178,Whiskey Tango Foxtrot,"What work better in the movie are mostly smaller moments: the jokes that land, the rapport between the reporters, and all the weirdly ordinary ways people manage to find a new normal, even in the most WTF circumstances.",B-

17183,Whispers in the Dark,"An OK whodunit with a memorable, unintentionally hilarious ending.",3/5
17184,White Nights,"White Nights is made by people who seem much more comfortable with dance than with the requirements of the Hollywood thriller. It comes to life in the dance sequences, and then drifts away again.",2.5/4

17186,White Bird in a Blizzard,"Too much good stuff to dismiss, despite a dull and desultory plot.",6/10

17193,White Fang 2: Myth of the White Wolf,"What's best about the film is a kind of fresh-air exuberance, an innocence.",3/4
17194,White God,It is a fantasia of canine madness that looks sometimes like a horror-thriller based on something by James Herbert or Stephen King - and sometimes like a tribute to Hitchcock's The Birds. Except that this time it's The Dogs.,4/5

17199,White Light/Black Rain: The Destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,"To say that watching this footage is harrowing would be an understatement -- and to call watching it ""painful"" would be a serious insult to the survivors.",4/5
17200,White Lightnin',"Dominic Murphy's pseudo-biopic is as visually assured as it is audacious, but behind the slickly edited imagery, the debutant's storytelling is exposed by shallow characterisation.",3/5
17201,White Lightning,"Burt, moonshine, car chases. What's not to like?",3/5
17202,White Material,Claire Denis provides only glimmers of her usual greatness with her tale about modern-day French colonials.,3/5
17203,White Men Can't Jump,"Here is a comedy of great high spirits, with an undercurrent of sadness and sweetness that makes it a lot better than the plot itself could possibly suggest.",3.5/4
17204,White Noise,An utterly abysmal wannabe-horror film. Never even remotely frighteningthe trailer is worlds above this lame finished product in terms of a visceral response.,0.5/4
17205,White Noise 2,It's a lot better than you might think!,3/5
17206,White Oleander,There's so much in White Oleander that really works that it's easy to forgive the Movie of the Week storyline.,3.5/5
17207,White Rabbit,The trite way Southern life is represented in the film makes the main character's potential endgame seem stagnantly preordained and one-note.,1/4
17208,White Rabbit,"White Rabbit is a whirlwind of expression and feelings. With quirkiness at its center, the story itself can feel aimless and without a purpose. But truly, it reflects its lead's journey towards meaning.",3.5/5
17209,The White Ribbon (Das weisse Band),"A profoundly disquieting movie, superbly acted and directed. Its sinister riddle glitters more fiercely each time I watch it.",5/5
17210,White Sands,An intriguing mystery with good performances and a crisp style.,3/5
17211,White Squall,"This rousing salute to the power of the elements, the lost innocence of the Kennedy era, and the goodness of young men when they are allowed to ripen with their shirts off is, above all, a tone poem.",B-
17212,The White Stripes Under Great White Northern Lights,"The live footage electrifies, filmed in either black and white or through a filter of the group's trademark red, with Malloy capturing the excitement of fans not used to seeing their heroes set up instruments on their very doorstep.",3/5
17213,White Water Summer,"Most stunning is how abruptly the film ends, but I suppose that's to be expected when a production simply runs out of money.",2/5
17214,White Zombie,An entrancing and spooky masterpiece of sorts.,3.5/5
17215,Whiteboyz,Not funny. At all.,1.5/5
17216,Whitewash,The thin plot gains what traction it has from Church's performance. He excels in the role of a man gradually losing his grip on reality in the frozen north.,3/4
17217,Whitey: United States of America v. James J. Bulger,"...what makes Joe Berlinger's riveting new true crime doc Whitey such an eye-opener is that it isn't just about a bad guy who did bad things, but the layers of corruption and moral ambiguity that stacked up on both side of the law.",A
17218,Whitney,Many of us missed Whitney even before she left; this imperfect documentary preys calmly and effectively on that longing.,3/5
17219,Who Killed Nancy?,"For an expos very little is actually revealed, but as a neon-lit trawl through '70s New York, it's worth a look.",2/5
17220,Jackie Chan's Who Am I? (Wo shi shei) (Who Am I?),One of Jackie Chan's best. A compelling mystery plot and some of the greatest action he's ever done. The rooftop fight is brilliant.,4/5
17221,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"Apart from the interesting premise and the novelty of seeing so many famous cartoon characters together on the screen, I was overall disappointed and it completely failed to live up to my memory.",2.5/4
17222,Who Is Dayani Cristal?,"There's a really good documentary in Who Is Dayani Cristal?, or perhaps there is a strong narrative if they focused on it, but given the problematic nature of the narrative segments, I'm going to go with the documentary portion.",4/10
17223,Who is Harry Nilsson (And Why is Everybody Talkin' About Him)?,...does something that few such films accomplish: it allows the audience to feel as though they have walked a mile in a man's shoes.,A
17224,Who is KK Downey?,KK has a DIY quality that is surprisingly appealing.,7/10
17225,Who Killed Cock Robin,The effect of piling on twist upon twist is to have the viewer totally wrung out and exasperated by the end.,2/5
17226,Who Killed the Electric Car?,"Given the increasingly dire predictions about global climate change and the state of affairs in the Middle East, developing a car that doesn't require gasoline seems like a no-brainer.",3.5/5
17227,Who Needs Enemies,It's a promising feature debut for Stylianou; let's hope he explores fresher territory next time.,4/5
17228,Who the #$&% Is Jackson Pollock?,"Who needs a piercingly satiric mockumentary when you have this lively documentary's broad, real-life personalities?",3/5

17230,The Whole Nine Yards,"It's laugh-out-loud, side-splitting funny.",3/4
17231,The Whole Ten Yards,"The zany hitman action-comedy sequel that nobody asked for -- and yes, in case you're wondering, it's every bit as nonsensical and overitalicized a mess as The Whole Nine Yards.",C
17232,The Whole Wide World,Robert E. Howard himself may have been a more interesting character than any of his fantastic creations,B+
17233,Who'll Stop the Rain,"A tough and thoughtful thriller, marked by a terrific Nolte performance.",4/5
17234,Wholly Moses!,"The movie's not funny on its own, and since movie audiences are scarcely going to be shocked by its mild but relentlessly repetitive irreverence, it all boils down to a very old joke.",1/4
17235,Whores' Glory,A boundary-breaking documentary about the world's oldest profession as seen in three cities.,B+
17236,Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,It earns the hell that it puts us through by never compromising its vision of it.,4/4
17237,Who's Camus Anyway?,"Who's Camus Anyway doesn't simply reflect our love for the movies, it responds to it as well.",3.5/4
17238,Who's Driving Doug,The movie fails to create a full character out of Doug beyond his disability and general social awkwardness. Mitte's broad performance matches filmmaking that paints a muddy picture of the hero's specific disability.,1/4

17240,Who's That Girl?,One of Madonna's shining moments in films,3/5
17241,Who's That Knocking at My Door?,"As a film, it has something to say to everyone. As a technical achievement, it brings together two opposing worlds of American cinema.",3.5/4
17242,Who's Watching Oliver,"Torture porn lives on in the #MetToo era, though this gruesome glib serial slaughter romance makes you wonder why",1/4
17243,Who's Your Caddy?,"The movie decides, after 30 minutes of black people clowning like it's 1939, to be a melodrama about injustice and, sigh, redemption.",0.5/4

17245,Why Did I Get Married?,"Stiffly written, didactic, and whiplash-inducing in its tonal shifts.",C
17246,Why Did I Get Married Too,"If Perry's cinematic vision remains less than 20/20, his sagacity gets stronger by the movie.",2.5/4
17247,Why Do Fools Fall In Love,Writer Tina Andrews' 15-year effort to bring this story of an extraordinary individual with a humpty-dumpty-life to the screen pays off big time. Here's one for the ages.,2.5/4
17248,"Why Don't You Just Die! (Papa, sdokhni)","This is not a film to see, if you can't stand the sight of blood... If you're desensitized to these things, for better or worse, such as myself, then you'll laugh and cringe and love the whole damn thing.",7/10
17249,Why Don't You Play in Hell?,"...an ambivalently loving tribute to both the action movie and filmmaking in general, not so much blood-splattered as blood-drenched. It seems destined to be a midnight movie cult hit, but still feels very much a Sono film.",B+
17250,Why Him?,"There are plenty of chuckles sprinkled throughout the bloated running time of Why Him?, but it never finds that sublime sweet spot where the chuckles become sustained laughs.",5/10
17251,Why Stop Now?,"Isn't very funny or poignant, drifting somewhere in between while the actors make the best out of a lackluster storytelling situation.",C-
17252,Wichita,"This superb Western, one of the best ever made, is not only enjoyable but is thought-provoking.",A
17253,Wicked Little Things,"It is a fun undead romp with very attractive girls, creepy kids, and a good amount of the ole dark and chunky. If that's all you want out of it, you won't be disappointed.",3/5
17254,Wicker Park,A slick movie with a nice-looking cast and a script that strips away everything that made the original so elusive and involving.,2.5/5
17255,Wide Awake,A fascinatingly self-indulgent look at one man's battle with insomnia.,B

17257,Widows,"It's a propulsive, artful genre work that finds something electric and unnerving in familiar material, elevating every moment with perfectly considered casting and a willingness to find unconventional choices and run with them.",4/5
17258,Widows' Peak,"Widow's Peak is another of those sly, witty, quietly ribald comedies that have been coming out of Ireland in the last few years.",3.5/4
17259,Wiener-Dog,"[Sundance 2016] An alternately tender, blunt and acridly satiric meditation on the process of life and death in all its natural, bitter forms.",3/4
17260,The Wilby Conspiracy,The film is a confused mishmash of genres and inexplicable character moments that fail to coalesce into something greater.,5/10
17261,Wilby Wonderful,Writer/director Daniel MacIvor does a wonderful job of establishing this small town...,3/4
17262,Wild,Witherspoon's Wild is tame enough to maybe actually give her a second act to her career.,2/4
17263,Wild America,Highly recommended for the SegaGenesis jocks in your household.,3/5
17264,The Wild Angels,"It manages to be exploitative, lifeless, and boring at the same time!",1/5
17265,Wild Bill,The movie itself is a lot of deadwood in the competitive holiday season.,2/4
17266,Wild Bill,The steady - but never sluggish - pace allows the characters to live and breathe.,4/5
17267,Wild City,"Although ""Wild City"" might not be top-drawer Lam, that he has released his first feature film in 12 years is a cause for celebration.",2/4
17268,Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell,"A tender, fascinating documentary by Matt Wolf, will delight the cult and instantly convert new members.",4.5/5
17269,Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken,"The movie has undeniable charms, and yet I found myself unpersuaded, perhaps because I resist having my emotions manipulated with cinematic chiropractic.",2/4
17270,Wild Hogs,"It's hard to hate it, trashing the film would be kind of like kicking a puppy in the head.",3/5
17271,Wild Honey Pie!,Wild Honey Pie is one you can pass on and spend your time doing better things... like poking at your eye with a toothpick.,5/10
17272,"Wild Horse, Wild Ride",This documentary shows the beginning of some beautiful friendships.,3/5
17273,Wild Horses,"The final title card deems the movie ""a tale that is told,"" but like that fragmentary statement, Wild Horses has nothing fresh to say.",C

17277,The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill,"Interesting man, flighty birds, but repetitious.",C
17278,Wild River,Evocative sociological/historical melodrama.,A-
17279,Wild Rose,"It's a little better than some of its ilk, thanks to Buckley's commitment and some nice support from Sophie Okonedo and Julie Walters, but you can feel the formula in every scene.",3/5
17280,Wild Rovers,Never kicks in as anything more than a fashionable mood piece.,B
17281,Wild Strawberries,A deeply moving film that extends beyond Bergman's experiences and speaks to the importance of emotional connections among human beings.,3.5/4
17282,Wild Style,"A fascinating study of an era that now feels so remote, it might as well have occurred on another planet.",4/5
17283,Wild Tales,...it only cements Szifron's clear talent...,B
17284,Wild Target,"Nothing feels like it's been properly thought through, highlighted by the fact that Nighy's 'super assassin' goes about his business by merely opening fire on a crowded market place (using a silencer, of course!).",2/5
17285,Wild Thing,"There's a movie here, all right. The question is, where is it? And how did Wild Thing so decisively miss so many opportunities to do something with it?",1.5/4
17286,Wild Things,"A fun movie about a community of people with larceny in their hearts, which delivers humor, some whodunit mystery, and quite a few samples of good-old trashy dialogue.",9/10
17287,The Wild Thornberrys Movie,A competent but mediocre animated adventure.,2/5
17288,Vince Vaughn's Wild West Comedy Show: 30 Days & 30 Nights - Hollywood to the Heartland,Comedy with a social conscious. How refreshing.,4/4
17289,Wild Wild West,"Basically, what you see in the trailer is what you get, and nothing more.",1.5/4
17290,Wildcats,Wildcats is about how spunky Hawn is and how cute it's supposed to be that this little woman can make all those great big football players do what she says.,1.5/4
17291,Wilde,"Wilde keeps itself at a remove from its passionate, flamboyant subject, and kept me from gaining any new understanding.",6/10
17292,Wilderness,It's nasty and bloody with enough mayhem to make most horror fans overlook some even more horrific dialogue.,2/5
17293,Wilderness Survival For Girls,"Like many a horror movie, the unfolding drama has moments that test credulity. Yet writer-directors Eli Despres and Kim Roberts' teasing of genres and handling of actors also hints at psychologically insightful films to come.",2.5/4
17294,Wildlife,"With every new moment of restrained poeticism, it's astounding this is a director's first time behind the camera.",A
17295,Wildling,I do recommend that genre fans keep an eye out for Wildling (it would make for a great double feature alongside Ginger Snaps or even last year's Raw).,4/5
17296,Will,"It just feels rather silly, as if it assumes such a reverent audience couldn't possibly need anything as pedestrian as believable characters or a likely plotline.",2/5
17297,Will Ferrell: You're Welcome America - A Final Night with George W Bush,Ferrell does a fine job spinning the presidency on its heels and he provides a generous dose of laughs (the bit where he gives the audience nicknames is a hoot and the product of improv genius).,6/10
17298,Will Penny,One of the most underrated Westerns ever made.,A
17299,Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?,"Tashlin had a huge stylistic impact on the New Wave. Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, his greatest film, is the template for Godard's bold use of primary colors and 'Scope in the 60s.",4/4
17300,Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?,"Arvin Chen's Taiwan is dominated by eccentricity in tone and atmosphere, but in a very careful, pronounced way, as to never really run the danger of being truly strange.",1.5/4
17301,Willard,"...as good as the actors are and as astounding as the set design is, Willard nevertheless runs out of steam towards the end.",2.5/4
17302,William S. Burroughs: A Man Within,It's a persuasive documentary; one that ought to gain Burroughs some new converts if the film itself can find a wide enough audience.,4/5
17303,William,"Thoughtful, smart sci-fi melodrama about cloning a Neanderthal. It lacks the dramatic fireworks to be of more consequence.",2.5/4
17304,Romeo + Juliet,You definitely need an open mind to accept this one.,2.5/4
17305,Willow,"I absolutely loved this movie, from beginning to end. And, for some oddly strange reason, I never could really tell why I enjoyed it so much.",4/4
17306,Willow Creek,A fun addition to the found-footage horror subgenre.,7/10
17307,Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"The zany factory's imaginative gimmicks, and that vivid color scheme, will keep even the youngest kids alert.",3/4
17308,Wilson,"""Sweet and occasionally riotously funny, but it treats the material too simplistically.",B-

17310,Win a Date With Tad Hamilton!,"I run the risk of turning away the male audience if I use the word ""darling."" So instead, I'll say that genders will enjoy ""Win a Date With Tad Hamilton,"" a fine film.",3.5/4
17311,Win It All,"It's a dense character study that rests on the shoulders of Jake Johnson, who delivers his strongest performance to date, casually handling every scene with a magnetism that recalls the likes of '70s era De Niro and Caan.",B+
17312,Win Win,A film with a big heart; it's an eccentric dramedy and a crowd pleaser.,5/5

17320,Windtalkers,"Packs a strong amount of firepower--not only in terms of pyrotechnics, but also in emotional impact.",3/4
17321,Wine Country,"Director Poehler clearly allowed for improv on set, but she also kept this film from losing its shape the way so many ""SNL""-tied films before it have.",3/4

17323,Winged Migration,There are no words to describe the poetic beauty of this film.,4/4
17324,Wings,"Admittedly, this movie has not aged as well as many of its contemporaries, but it's not hard to understand why it was accorded the Oscar (a term that, by the way, had not yet been coined).",3/4
17325,Wings of Desire,"...like no movie you've ever seen. At once mesmerizing and perplexing, this is a film about love and despair and the choices mortals have in dealing with each.",3/4
17326,The Wings of Eagles,This routine sentimental biopic is directed with much feeling by John Ford.,C
17327,The Wings of the Dove,"Simply a film that did not rub me at all, much less the wrong way.",2.5/5
17328,Winnebago Man,"Don't laugh TOO hard at those YouTube 'fools.' That's you and me, don't forget.",4/5
17329,Winnie Mandela,"The source material is Anne Marie du Preez Bezdrob's biography, and the period detail is spot on. Yet Winnie: the movie opts to wear its heart openly on its sleeve, and play it absurdly safe.",2/5
17330,Winnie the Pooh,"Short and sweet, Winnie the Pooh positively refuses to outstay its welcome. It takes us by the hand and quietly reminds us of a simpler time when 3D and CGI were a mere twinkle in someone's eye.",3.5/5
17331,The Winning Season,"As the film progresses, its identity crisis becomes increasingly evident as standard indie tropes are interrupted by cackhanded attempts at comedy of the broadest type.",2.5/5
17332,Winning: The Racing Life Of Paul Newman,"A highly informative and loving tribute to the star's ""secret"" life, striving to indentify a thirst for competition and speed that drove him to seek pleasure on the race track.",B

17348,Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies,"A cheap, quick-fix horror sequel that methodically destroys its predecessor's shaky appeal.",1/5

17353,The Witches of Eastwick,"There are some moments in The Witches of Eastwick that stretch uncomfortably for effects, and yet a lot of the time this movie plays like a plausible story about implausible people. The performances sell it.",3.5/4
17354,Witching and Bitching,...contains a terminally meandering midsection that ultimately drains the film of its energy and renders its positive attributes moot.,1.5/4
17355,With a Friend like Harry...,Moll has given us a black comedy with superior performances from the entire ensemble.,9/10
17356,With Friends Like These,"At its best, Philip Frank Messina's show business comedy plays like a less acerbic, less Jewish triple episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.",3/5

17388,Woman on Top,What really seems to be missing here is the maturity to create continuity within the fantasy -- something even Saturday cartoons try to do.,2/5
17389,Woman Thou Art Loosed,You know girlfriend is in trouble when she walks into church without a bra.,1.5/4
17390,Woman Thou Art Loosed: On the 7th Day,An attractive cast act out a story of kidnapping and adultery under TV-style directing.,B-
17391,A Woman Under the Influence,"John Cassavetes' pioneering independent film represents a hallmark of the indie scene, but at its heart is an excellent story told exceedingly badly.",3/5
17392,Woman Walks Ahead,"Woman Walks Ahead is a solidly crafted and well shot, if basically unchallenging film.",3/5
17393,!Women Art Revolution,"Passionate, contentious, funny, sincere, politically attuned.",4/5
17394,Women in Trouble,Guys may remember this film as the finest collection of ladies who almost take it all off ever assembled. But in-between all the underwear and fetish outfits is a rather amusing collection of stories described by its very title.,3/4
17395,Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (Mujeres al Borde de un Ataque de Nervios),Women on the Verge is even wackier than [Almodovar's] other films -- it also just happens to be more universal.,3.5/4
17396,"Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood","Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood is such a good-natured mess of a movie that it's hard not to like it.",3.5/5
17397,Wonder,The feel-good film of the year and one that reminds the world to be kind to one another.,8/10
17398,Wonder Boys,"It's been quite some time that a movie was actually able to make me feel refreshed after a viewing, or simply nudge me into revisiting my own life under a different source of light, but this movie did just that.",8/10
17399,Wonder Park,"As far as Wonder Park goes, it's basic, but not condescending.",6.2/10
17400,Wonder Wheel,If there's a thread that keeps this cloth together it's Kate Winslet's scintillating and lucent performance.,2.5/4
17401,Wonder Woman,I really enjoyed my short time spent with the character and her mythos...,3/4
17402,Wonder Woman,Gadot turns out to be as perfect a fit for the iconic character as Christopher Reeve was for the Man of Steel.,4/5
17403,Wonder Woman: Bloodlines,"Wonder Woman: Bloodlines is an origin story with relationship overload. There's action a plenty and fair amount of entertainment value, but takes a melodramatic step back from the greatness of DC's last two years of animated films.",2.5/5
17404,The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit,"A wonderful, magical movie.",4/5
17405,Wonderful Town,Contemplative cinema with nothing to contemplate.,0.5/4
17406,Wonderland,It hits you like a ton of dope,4.5/5
17407,Wonders Are Many: The Making of Doctor Atomic,"The film oddly attempts to combine the backstage production footage with history-lesson segments. While skillfully crafted, the two stories never quite mesh, and neither go deep enough to work on their own.",2.5/5
17408,Wonders of the Sea,...there's no denying that what the film gently says does matter.,3/5
17409,Wonderstruck,"Gorgeous, moving, and innovatively told, it may even be too smart for some adults. Kids will get it just fine, though.",4/5
17410,Wonderwall,Wonderwall should be required viewing for anyone interested in popular culture of the 1960s...,7/10
17411,Wong Fei-hung chi tit gai dau neung gung (Deadly China Hero) (Claws of Steel) (Last Hero in China),"All in all, this is an entertainingly stupid action comedy that never takes itself too seriously but fails to reach either the same level of excitement as Hark's Wong Fei-hung series.",2.5/5
17412,Won't Back Down,An entertaining inspirational story about people making a difference that should at least get the viewer interested in exploring the realities in making change.,7.5/10
17413,Won't You Be My Neighbor?,"For the many generations that grew up with Rogers' friendly face as their guide, Won't You Be My Neighbor is like peering into the past with renewed clarity and wishing his civility had caught on.",A-

17416,Woodlawn,An inspiring film that shows the power of faith and forgiveness on and off the field.,3/4
17417,Woodshock,"There's more thought going into the color filters, which classic post punk songs to play on a jukebox, and the bra and nightgown selection than anything resembling character building or story.",1/5
17418,The Woodsman,"A character who is doomed from the start because of his own actions is difficult to support, and a film about him is bound to feel oppressively dark.",C

17420,Woodstock: Three Days That Defined a Generation,"We may not have needed another Woodstock movie, but at least this one helps explain why every generation seems to get the Woodstock they deserve.",B-
17421,Woody Woodpecker,... the result leaves much to be desired. [Full review in Spanish],1/5
17422,Wool 100%,"If Tim Burton were to go to Japan to make a movie about two elderly sisters living in a house filled with junk, and a girl who invades their lives and spends day and night knitting a red sweater, it would be something like Wool 100%.",3/4
17423,Word Wars,"Quirky, entertaining documentary.",3.5/5
17424,Wordplay,"For those curious as to the activity's history, this quirky cast of characters provides all you want to know and more.",3/5
17425,Words and Music,Appallingly sanitized biopic of Rodgers and Hart.,2/5
17426,Words And Pictures,"An ill-fitting, occasionally awkward yarn that crackles at times (thanks to its charming leads), but struggles to fire.",2/5
17427,Working Girl,"Working Girl is Nichols returning to the top of his form, and Griffith finding hers.",4/4
17428,Working Girls,"Filmed in a near-documentary style, trying to hide that it's more or less a clinical study masked as a fiction film.",B-
17429,Working Man,Jury has crafted an internalized drama getting to the core of our values and the way we can become warped by them in the context of love and guilt.,B-
17430,Workingman's Death,Glawogger is an extraordinarily elegant filmmaker with a photographer's eye for striking compositions.,B+
17431,World War Z,"More an action blockbuster than a horror squelcher, it contains spectacular crowd scenes that have a Hieronymus Bosch quality, but the film lacks strong meat - of the emotional and bloody zombie-cannibal sort.",3/5
17432,The World According to Garp,"seems to waver between almost sitcom-like normality, and bizarre outlandishness",2.5/4
17433,The World Is Not Enough,"What it comes down to is the same thing every Bond comes down to; if you're a fan of the genre, than you'll enjoy this movie, which is easily one of the top ten Bond films.",3.5/4
17434,The World of Henry Orient,Charming story of childhood friendship with great young cast.,4/5
17435,The World of Suzie Wong,"[A] wildly romantic, vividly imagined color film.",3.5/5
17436,World of the Dead: The Zombie Diaries 2,"Zombies can't keep diaries, but if they did they'd be pretty repetitive, something Kevin Gates and Michael Bartlett's ambitious sequel to their 2006 DV horror could also be accused of.",2/5
17437,"The World, the Flesh and the Devil",According to this film racism is a bigger problem than even nuclear warfare.,C
17438,World Trade Center,"The most controversial element about Stone's film is how conventional and simple it is. This is not necessarily a bad thing since the drama was consciously made as a celebration of cherished American values: courage, risk, strength, and faith.",B
17439,The World Unseen,"One supposes that a muted drama about the trials of forbidden love set against the backdrop of one of the darker moments in human history isn't to be joyous, but a moment or two of levity wouldn't have killed anybody.",2/5
17440,The World's Fastest Indian,"Yes, it's well-made schmaltz, but that's not a bad thing.",3/5

17443,The Wraith,An enjoyably trashy sci-fi/car racing action movie.,3/5
17444,Wreck-it Ralph,"While only the first forty minutes are super, on the whole WRECK-IT RALPH is a whole lot of fun.",7/10
17445,Wrecked,"For first-time director Michael Greenspan, Wrecked stands as a future calling card to show just how much intrigue and audience involvement he can rile up with such a minimalist plot.",2.5/4
17446,Wrecker,"It's fast, slick and lovely to look at, but there's absolutely nothing there beneath the hood.",5/10
17447,Wrestling Ernest Hemingway,"Steve Conrad's debut screenplay says little that's new, but the actors make it fresher and more powerful than it has a right to be.",2.5/4
17448,Wrinkles,"A thought-provoking consideration of ageing from the perspective of the elderly that is, perhaps ironically, hard to forget.",4/5
17449,Wrinkles the Clown,"Wrinkles the Clown is a documentary that frequently entertains, but lacks true insight into the viral phenomenon.",5/10
17450,Wristcutters: A Love Story,"The Wizard of Oz meets What Dreams May Come by way of, oh I dunno, something post-apocalyptic, snarky, and fun.",4/5
17451,Written in Blood,doesn't make a lick of sense,2/5
17452,Wrong,"There's a lot going on in Wrong that shows intelligence, imagination and artistry. But I'm afraid it's another ""worthy effort""/""shows promise"" kind of movie.",B-
17453,Wrong Cops,"Some of these routines are hilarious, others forced, but they're all routines, not parts of a cohesive work.",3/5
17454,Wrong Is Right,"The star of Wrong Is Right is Sean Connery, giving the first uncertain performance of his otherwise exemplary career.",1.5/5
17455,Wrong Turn,'Deliverance' us! In this case the wrong turn is into the theater parking lot.,F
17456,Wrong Turn 2: Dead End,"A fast-paced and completely unapologetic love-letter to the old-school '80s splatter sequels like Friday the 13th Part 2 and Texas Chainsaw 2. (Gory, too!)",4/5
17457,Wrongfully Accused,"Clearly, Pat Proft was wearing too many hats, and both his writing and his directing suffered for it.",29/100
17458,Wu xia (Dragon),Peter Ho-Sun Chan and Deonnie Yen Chan are too resourceful to let things remain dull for long.,2.5/4
17459,Wuthering Heights,"It's an unmotivated, loose script with a rambling tale and impotent casting that degrades this otherwise mildly satisfying hanky-fest.",55/100
17460,Wuthering Heights,Arnold's approach does Brontë no disservice...,3/5
17461,X2: X-Men United,"Yes, there's action, fun, and even some well-earned tension. But X2 is simply lacking the gel, the magic, the super-power of that strong first film ""X-Men.""",2/4
17462,The X-Files: I Want to Believe (The X Files 2),I Want to Believe had the right strategy; too bad Carter and company couldn't commit to it.,2/4
17463,X-Men: The Last Stand,"Its concept hinted at real greatness, but the end result is never anything more than average.",3/5
17464,X-Men: Apocalypse,"Considering the amount of time spent watching Apocalypse round up his forces, you'd think he'd be a marginally interesting villain but that isn't the case.",3/5
17465,X-Men: Days of Future Past,"The best, most complete and most entertaining X-Men movie we've ever seen.",4.5/5
17466,X-Men: First Class,"It's intelligent and emotionally resonant, explosive and eye-dazzling. Factor in a zeitgeisty, hot-list cast and First Class is likely to be one of the summer's best biggies.",4/5
17467,X: Night of Vengeance,A wonderfully noir-ish effort...,3.5/5

17469,Xanadu,"campy joyful fun, with a wee bit too much cheese",2/5
17470,Xchange,"Though it's got a fairly interesting science fiction premise, Xchange abandons it in favor of routine action sequences...",2/4
17471,Xenia,An extravagant and fun work that shows a very different Greece at the one described in text books or the one we see in the news. [Full review in Spanish],3/5
17472,The X-Files - Fight the Future,A most unusual summer blockbuster: one that delivers the thrilling goods with an uncommon dose of intelligence and complexity.,3.5/4
17473,Xizao,"Shower is about everyday people, and although it has some contrived plot devices (including the looming deadline of the city's threat to the bathhouse), it is warm and observant, and its ending is surprisingly true to the material.",3/4
17474,X-Men,"While it's not perfect, it is unique: a big-budget comic-book movie populated by superheroes who have very uneasy relationships with Truth, Justice and the American Way.",3/5
17475,XOXO,"BTW, WWJD? JK, LMFAO XOXO.",3/5
17476,XX,"It's nice to see this kind of variation-unsettling, goofy, aggressive, redemptive-present inside a single collection.",2.5/5
17477,XX/XY,"Ultimately its characters are so self-centered, immature and ugly that one simply cannot empathize.",2/5
17478,XXX,Here's more expertly-made trash from director Rob Cohen.,2.5/4
17479,xXx: Return of Xander Cage,"It's a different kind of beast; one of those rare films that could very well draw whoops and cheers from certain audiences, and at the same time, it's equally possible that it puts the rest to sleep.",3/5
17480,xXx: State of the Union,"OK you don't expect a sequel to 2002's brainless XXX to be an action masterwork, but this is so preposterous that it feels like an overblown spoof of the original.",1.5/5
17481,XXY,"Ricardo Darin... again proves that he can break your heart with a look, conveying unspoken emotion with a glance that taps you into his pain.",4.5/5
17482,Y Tu Mama Tambien,"Y Tu Mam Tambin es un buen filme gracias a lo poco convencional de su narrativa, y es quiz el proyecto ms arriesgado en la carrera de Alfonso Cuarn",3/4
17483,Yakuza Apocalypse,Winning gags -- yakuza vampires and frog monsters included -- start off funny but then bludgeon you with repetition.,2/5
17484,Yankee Doodle Dandy,"It's heartfelt entertainment and anyone who ever whistled a tune, tapped a toe or hummed a bar of music will love it.",5/5
17485,Yanks,Finely made John Schlesinger film is worth another look.,4/5
17486,The Yards,A serious film that strives for a moral complexity and a textural density rarely found in contemporary dramas.,3.5/5
17487,Yarn,A scrappy but endearing documentary about mostly female artists and a traditionally feminine art form.,3/5
17488,Ye ben (Fleeing by Night),The film has the courage of its convictions and excellent performances on its side.,3/5
17489,The Year My Voice Broke,"Nice effort from Duigan, and a smashing introduction by Noah Taylor, who would fly so high in Shine.",3.5/5
17490,The Year of Living Dangerously,"The Year of Living Dangerously is a flawed film, but it is richly textured and imbued with enough emotional and intellectual subtlety to make it a rewarding experience.",79/100
17491,Year of the Comet,"Goldman's script features some sparkling one-liners, but the film's mix of action and romantic comedy often comes off as contrived rather than charming.",2/4
17492,Year of the Dog,"The supporting cast of Mike White's directorial debut offer plenty of laughs, but it always comes down to Molly Shannon being the movie's weak link.",6.5/10
17493,Year of the Fish,Written and directed by Reginald Harkema with a sharp eye toward the paradoxes of fighting The Man in the 21st century.,2.5/4
17494,Year One,Has its moments - especially Black and Cera's knockabout pairing - but Year One sidesteps greatness by allowing too much filler and swill to plug the gaps.,3/5
17495,Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani,[Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani] liberally echoes DDLJ and every other major romance to come out of Bollywood in the last two decades.,2.5/5
17496,Yella,"Too obscure and oblique in its aims to completely enthral, Yella manages to get under the skin thanks to Hoss' bewitching performance as the troubled number cruncher and a final reveal that complicates everything that's gone before.",3/5
17497,Yelling to the Sky,"Even though 'Yelling to the Sky' tumbles, Victoria Mahoney shows great promise as a director.",C
17498,Yellowbeard,Yellowbeard seems almost to have exhausted itself with its casting. This movie contains half the population of most of the movie comedies of the last decade.,1.5/4
17499,Yellowbrickroad,Unsettling and quite unlike any other horror flick you're likely to have seen.,3/4

17502,"Yes, God, Yes",A charming and highly engrossing feature debut from Karen Maine with a standout nuanced performance from Natalia Dyer.,3.5/5
17503,Yes Man,"The saving grace that it's actually watchable and funny at times doesn't make its premise any less ridiculous or its execution less formulaic, it just means it's not a complete waste of time",47/100
17504,The Yes Men,If you are the sort who enjoys the actions of people who exact revenge on 'those in power' by using extreme hoaxes and promoting satirical activism you are bound to enjoy this documentary.,3.5/5
17505,The Yes Men Fix the World,Entertainment that tickles the justice-for-all glands.,4/5
17506,Yesterday,The movie finds a much more creative and earnest way to honor a pop star act than the myriad of empty headed musical biopics we've been inundated with for decades.,3.5/5

17508,Yesterday Was a Lie,There is brilliance here that demonstrates the best of what independent filmmakers strive to do.,4.5/5
17509,Yoga Hosers,In his Sundance intro Smith called Yoga Hosers one of the dumbest movies ever made. He wasn't lying.,2/10

17513,Yom Yom,Monotonous Israeli drama.,1.5/5

17516,Yossi,Knoller's superbly underplayed performance ensures that Yossi's sad-sack tendencies aren't allowed to alienate him from our affections.,4/5
17517,You Don't Know Jack,"Jack remains a disturbing, significant picture, expressing a mind and a purpose coldly silenced before it was ever truly understood...finding the shadows and the soapbox, Pacino is masterful in this uneasy, thought-provoking drama.",A-
17518,You Won't Miss Me,"A work that radiates a boozy, Bukowski-esque downward spiral, all alcohol-fueled anger and aimless sadness.",3/5
17519,You Again,"There are no surprises here, just a by-the-numbers comedy that's better, and funnier, than it has a right to be, thanks to the efforts of the actors in it.",3/5
17520,You Can Count On Me,Ken Lonergan adds just enough unpredictable dialogue and creativity to make this movie the real deal.,4/5
17521,You Cannot Kill David Arquette,Call it Scream 5: Ring of Terror.,2.5/4
17522,You Can't Take It With You,You Can't Take it with You was a tonic to a Depression-weary country beginning to right itself economically.,3/4
17523,You Don't Mess With the Zohan,"Since the comedy is co-written by three scribes, my guess would be that the bathroom humor and childish goofiness are product of Sandler and company, whereas the more sexual and raunchy elements reflect the sensibility of Judd Apatow and his factory.",C
17524,You Don't Need Feet to Dance,"In a film plunked somewhat unfortunately between the inspirational and the ordinary, the impressively patient Mr. Conde voices public-service-announcement sentiments about being able to do as much as anyone else.",2.5/5

17529,You May Not Kiss the Bride,"The plotting just ends up feeling like a lot of business, ideas meant to keep the characters busy and in motion rather than actually reflecting anything like human behavior.",2/5
17530,"You, Me and Dupree","The most clever aspect of You, Me and Dupree is its rhyming title...after that, it's one long, steep decline into suffering.",1/4
17531,You Might Be the Killer,...a progressively repetitive midsection that highlights the decidedly one-note bent of the movie's storyline...,1.5/4
17532,You Only Live Twice,There are so many questions that the script never answers.,2/4
17533,You Should Have Left,"You Should Have Left is a perfect example of how ""forgettable"" horror cinema is somehow more tedious than something that goes out in a blaze of failed ambition.",3/10
17534,You Were Never Really Here,A psycho-noir featuring a stunning lead performance by Joaquin Phoenix.,5/5
17535,You Will Be My Son,"Leisurely paced at the outset, director Gilles Legrand builds a considerable head of emotional steam.",3/5

17537,Young Adult,An impressive departure for both Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody...,3.5/4
17538,Young & Beautiful (Jeune Et Jolie),Winner of this year's Drive Award for having the most blatantly narrative songs shoe-horned in to reinforce a key message.,3/5
17539,Young and Innocent,"Vintage Hitchcock. The tracking shot near the end is priceless, a great example of using the camera to let the audience in on something while the hero remains in the dark.",3/5
17540,Young at Heart,"Not as good as the original, but Ethel Barrymore is terrific.",4/5
17541,The Young Black Stallion,"Like the subject of the story, this film is swift and beautiful, knows where it's going and how to get there fast.",4/5

17546,The Young Lions,"Belssimo filme sobre a segunda guerra, mostrando ponto de vistas de soldados de ambos os lados do front. Brando, obviamente, assume o papel de alemo - e sua humanidade faz contraponto aos horrores que testemunha.",5/5
17547,Young Man With a Horn,a fair example of a somewhat overworked genre.,3.5/5
17548,Young Mr. Lincoln,"Henry Fonda's characterization is one of those once-in-a-blue-moon things: a crossroads meeting of nature, art and a smart casting director.",5/5
17549,Young Ones,"As much as I wanted to enjoy it, Young Ones' over-stretched plot and stunted script leaves it feeling like an art-house short that was given too much money.",5/10
17550,The Young Savages,It's a West Side Story without the romance and music.,C+

17553,Young Yakuza,Juggling restraint and boldness to tackle this subject on many unexpected layers establishes this work as a brilliant effort.,4/5
17554,Young@Heart,This entertaining and often moving documentary should help even the youngest of viewer get in touch with their own mortality and make it clear that life doesn't have to end at 60.,8.5/10
17555,Il Tuo Vizio è una Stanza Chiusa e Solo Io ne ho la Chiave (Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key),"Indulgent title it may have, but everything else about this fine, tight, tense movie is the very opposite of indulgence.",8/10

17604,Zombie Strippers,"It's not as fast-paced or silly as it ought to be, mostly because Lee doesn't really seem to know what he's doing behind the camera.",2/5
