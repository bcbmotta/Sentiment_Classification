# Movie Reviews Sentiment Classification

Applied Language Learning Models (LLM) to classify movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes by sentiments.

- Used GTP-3.5 to train a sentiment classifier model.
- Downloaded a dataset from Kaggle with reviews from Rotten Tomatoes, without sentiments labels.
- Used trained model to classify reviews between positive, negative, and neutral.

**Notes:**
The free version of OpenAI's API has a limit of 3 requests per minute. That's why the training took 10 min to be done and the application was done in only a sample of 3 reviews.
